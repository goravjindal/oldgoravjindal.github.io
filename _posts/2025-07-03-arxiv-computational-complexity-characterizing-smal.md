In this paper, we provide a uniform framework for investigating small circuit
classes and bounds through the lens of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Following an approach recently introduced to capture the class of
polynomial-time computable functions via ODE-based recursion schemas and later
applied to the context of functions computed by unbounded fan-in circuits of
constant depth (FAC^0), we study multiple relevant small circuit classes. In
particular, we show that natural restrictions on linearity and derivation along
functions with specific growth rate correspond to kinds of functions that can
be proved to be in various classes, ranging from FAC^0 to FAC^1. This reveals
an intriguing link between constraints over linear-length ODEs and circuit
computation, providing new tools to tackle the complex challenge of
establishing bounds for classes in the circuit hierarchies and possibly
enhancing our understanding of the role of counters in this setting.
Additionally, we establish several completeness results, in particular
obtaining the first ODE-based characterizations for the classes of functions
computable in constant depth with unbounded fan-in and Mod 2 gates (FACC[2])
and in logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in Boolean gates (FNC1).
