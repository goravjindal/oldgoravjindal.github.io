The Zarankiewicz problem, a cornerstone problem in extremal graph theory,
asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that does not
contain the complete bipartite graph $K\_{s,s}$. While the problem remains
widely open in the case of general graphs, the past two decades have seen
significant progress on this problem for various restricted graph classes --
particularly those arising from geometric settings -- leading to a deeper
understanding of their structure.
In this paper, we develop a new structural tool for addressing
Zarankiewicz-type problems. More specifically, we show that for any positive
integer $k$, every graph with average degree $d$ either contains an induced
$C\_4$-free subgraph with average degree at least $k$, or it contains a
$d$-vertex subgraph with $\Omega\_k(d^2)$ edges. As an application of this
dichotomy, we propose a unified approach to a large number of Zarankiewicz-type
problems in geometry, obtaining optimal bounds in each case.
