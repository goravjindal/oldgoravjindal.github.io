We address the problem of allocating limited resources in a network under
persistent yet statistically unknown adversarial attacks. Each node in the
network may be degraded, but not fully disabled, depending on its available
defensive resources. The objective is twofold: to minimize total system damage
and to reduce cumulative resource allocation and transfer costs over time. We
model this challenge as a bi-objective optimization problem and propose a
decomposition-based solution that integrates chance-constrained programming
with network flow optimization. The framework separates the problem into two
interrelated subproblems: determining optimal node-level allocations across
time slots, and computing efficient inter-node resource transfers. We
theoretically prove the convergence of our method to the optimal solution that
would be obtained with full statistical knowledge of the adversary. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our method efficiently learns the adversarial
patterns and achieves substantial gains in minimizing both damage and
operational costs, comparing three benchmark strategies under various parameter
settings.
