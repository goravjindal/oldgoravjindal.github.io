The Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH), recently established
by Hirahara-Ohsaka (STOC'24) and Karthik-Manurangsi (ECCC'24), studies the
hardness of reconfiguring one solution into another in constraint satisfaction
problems (CSP) when restricted to approximate intermediate solutions. In this
work, we make a tighter connection between RIH's soundness gap and that of
probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity (PCPP). Consequently, we
achieve an improved trade-off between soundness and query complexity in Gap CSP
Reconfiguration. Our approach leverages a parallelization framework, which also
appears in some recent parameterized inapproximability results.
