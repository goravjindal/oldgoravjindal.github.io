We prove that Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle are NP-hard on graphs of
linear mim-width 26, even when a linear order of the input graph with mim-width
26 is provided together with input. This fills a gap left by a broken proof of
the para-NP-hardness of Hamiltonicity problems parameterized by mim-width.
