We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian cycle
with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set.
We show that the path problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth
4 while the cycle problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete on graphs of pathwidth 5.
We complement these results by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of
pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2 for Hamiltonian paths as well as pathwidth 4 and
treewidth 3 for Hamiltonian cycles. Furthermore, we study the complexity of the
path and cycle problems on rectangular grid graphs of bounded height. For
these, we show that the path and cycle problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when
the height of the grid is greater or equal to 7 and 9, respectively. In the
variant where we look for minimum edge-weighted Hamiltonian paths and cycles,
the problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for heights 5 and 6, respectively.
