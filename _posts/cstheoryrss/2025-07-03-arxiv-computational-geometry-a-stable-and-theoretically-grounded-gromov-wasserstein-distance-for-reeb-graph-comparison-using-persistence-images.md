Reeb graphs are a fundamental structure for analyzing the topological and
geometric properties of scalar fields. Comparing Reeb graphs is crucial for
advancing research in this domain, yet existing metrics are often
computationally prohibitive or fail to capture essential topological features
effectively. In this paper, we explore the application of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a versatile metric for comparing metric measure
spaces, to Reeb graphs. We propose a framework integrating a symmetric variant
of the Reeb radius for robust geometric comparison, and a novel probabilistic
weighting scheme based on Persistence Images derived from extended persistence
diagrams to effectively incorporate topological significance. A key
contribution of this work is the rigorous theoretical proof of the stability of
our proposed Reeb Gromov-Wasserstein distance with respect to perturbations in
the underlying scalar fields. This ensures that small changes in the input data
lead to small changes in the computed distance between Reeb graphs, a critical
property for reliable analysis. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach,
including its enhanced ability to capture topological features and its proven
stability, through comparisons with other alternatives on several datasets,
showcasing its practical utility and theoretical soundness.
