Morse-Cerf theory considers a one-parameter family of smooth functions
defined on a manifold and studies the evolution of their critical points with
the parameter. This paper presents an adaptation of Morse-Cerf theory to a
family of piecewise-linear (PL) functions. The vertex diagram and Cerf diagram
are introduced as representations of the evolution of critical points of the PL
function. The characterization of a crossing in the vertex diagram based on the
homology of the lower links of vertices leads to the definition of a
topological descriptor for time-varying scalar fields. An algorithm for
computing the Cerf diagram and a measure for comparing two Cerf diagrams are
also described together with experimental results on time-varying scalar
fields.
