The worst-case additive sensitivity of a string repetitiveness measure $c$ is
defined to be the largest difference between $c(w)$ and $c(w')$, where $w$ is a
string of length $n$ and $w'$ is a string that can be obtained by performing a
single-character edit operation on $w$. We present $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bounds
for the worst-case additive sensitivity of the smallest string attractor size
$\gamma$ and the smallest bidirectional scheme size $b$, which match the known
lower bounds $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for $\gamma$ and $b$ [Akagi et al. 2023].
Further, we present matching upper and lower bounds for the worst-case additive
sensitivity of the Lempel-Ziv family - $\Theta(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for LZSS and
LZ-End, and $\Theta(n)$ for LZ78.
