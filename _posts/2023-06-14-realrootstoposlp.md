Hao Huang recently presented a remarkably [simple proof](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2019/190-3/p06) of the long-standing Sensitivity Conjecture. Below, I provide an almost self-contained explanation of Huang's proof. While originally intended for my personal understanding, it may also be helpful to others.
