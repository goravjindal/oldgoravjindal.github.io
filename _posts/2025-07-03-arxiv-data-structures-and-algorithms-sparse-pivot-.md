We present a new Correlation Clustering algorithm for a dynamic setting where
nodes are added one at a time. In this model, proposed by Cohen-Addad,
Lattanzi, Maggiori, and Parotsidis (ICML 2024), the algorithm uses database
queries to access the input graph and updates the clustering as each new node
is added. Our algorithm has the amortized update time of
$O\_{\epsilon}(\log^{O(1)}(n))$. Its approximation factor is $20+\varepsilon$,
which is a substantial improvement over the approximation factor of the
algorithm by Cohen-Addad et al. We complement our theoretical findings by
empirically evaluating the approximation guarantee of our algorithm. The
results show that it outperforms the algorithm by Cohen-Addad et al.~in
practice.
