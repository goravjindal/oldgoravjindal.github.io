We present a real-time deformation method for Escher tiles -- interlocking
organic forms that seamlessly tessellate the plane following symmetry rules. We
formulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is
to deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting
displacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our
method processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations
such as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we
consider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior
deform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive
tool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise
adjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic
control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various
examples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in
applications such as fabrication and animation.
