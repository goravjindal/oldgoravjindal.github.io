We consider the problem of enumerating the irreducible closed sets of a
closure system given by an implicational base. In the context of Horn logic,
these correspond to Horn expressions and characteristic models, respectively.
To date, the complexity status of this problem is widely open, and it is
further known to generalize the notorious hypergraph dualization problem, even
in the context of acyclic convex geometries, i.e., closure systems admitting an
acyclic implicational base. This paper studies this later class with a focus on
the degree, which corresponds to the maximal number of implications in which an
element occurs. We show that the problem is tractable for bounded values of
this parameter, even when relaxed to the notions of premise- and
conclusion-degree. Our algorithms rely on structural properties of acyclic
convex geometries and involve various techniques from algorithmic enumeration
such as solution graph traversal, saturation techniques, and a sequential
approach leveraging from acyclicity. They are shown to perform in
incremental-polynomial time for the computation of irreducible closed sets, and
in polynomial time for the construction of an implicational base. Finally, we
argue that our running times cannot be improved to polynomial delay using the
standard framework of flashlight search.
