I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](Max Planck Institute for Software Systems), working with [Joël Ouaknine](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~joel/).

Prior that I was a Postdoctoral researcher at the [Facets of Complexity](http://www.facetsofcomplexity.de/) and [Institut für Mathematik, TU Berlin](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/) with [Prof. Dr. Peter Bürgisser](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_diskalg/fachgebiet_algorithmische_algebra/v_menue/members/prof_dr_peter_buergisser/)

Before this,  I was a Postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Computer Science, Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/department-of-computer-science) with [Prof. Parinya Chalermsook](https://sites.google.com/site/parinyachalermsook/home).

I obtained my PhD degree in 2019 from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), where I was advised by [Prof. Markus Bläser](https://www-cc.cs.uni-saarland.de/mblaeser/).  During my doctoral studies phase, I was also a member of [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity/). Before that, I completed my Masters studies from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html). 

 I did my bachelor studies from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/). A brief [CV](/cv/) can be found here. My proudest achievement can be found [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/1109380107).
