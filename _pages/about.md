I am a **Samuel Eilenberg Assistant Professor** at the **Institute of Informatics**, [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/en/), [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl/), since February 2025.  

Previously, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), working with [Joël Ouaknine](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~joel/). Prior to that, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [Facets of Complexity](http://www.facetsofcomplexity.de/) and the [Institut für Mathematik, TU Berlin](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/), working with [Prof. Dr. Peter Bürgisser](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_diskalg/fachgebiet_algorithmische_algebra/v_menue/members/prof_dr_peter_buergisser/).  

Before this, I was a **visiting doctoral candidate** at the [Department of Computer Science, Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/department-of-computer-science), working with [Prof. Parinya Chalermsook](https://sites.google.com/site/parinyachalermsook/home).  

I obtained my **PhD degree in 2019** from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), where I was advised by [Prof. Markus Bläser](https://www-cc.cs.uni-saarland.de/mblaeser/). During my doctoral studies, I was also a member of the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity/). Prior to that, I completed my **Master’s studies** at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html).  

I did my **Bachelor’s studies** at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/).  

A brief **[CV](/cv/)** can be found here. My proudest achievement can be found [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/1109380107).
