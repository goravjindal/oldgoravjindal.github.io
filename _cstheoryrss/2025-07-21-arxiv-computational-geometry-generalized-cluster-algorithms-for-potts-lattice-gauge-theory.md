Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample
the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber
dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge
theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette
random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge
theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of
homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus.
Simulations for $\mathbb Z\_2$ and $\mathbb Z\_3$ lattice gauge theories on the
cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit
much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for
efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.
