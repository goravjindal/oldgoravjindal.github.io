Nonogram is a popular combinatorial puzzle (similar in nature to Sudoku or
Minesweeper) in which a puzzle solver must determine if there exists a setting
of the puzzle parameters that satisfy a given set of constraints. It has long
been known that the problem of deciding if a solution exists is a
computationally difficult problem. Despite this fact, humans still seem to
enjoy playing it. This work aims to reconcile these seemingly contradictory
facts by (1) analyzing the complexity of the inference problem for Nonogram
(the problem of determining if there exists a puzzle parameter that can be
inferred from the constraints without guessing) and (2) experimentally
establishing the existence of a phase transition behavior for this inference
problem. Our results show that the difficulty of the inference problem is
largely determined by the density of filled cells (positive parameters) in a
given puzzle. Along the way we implement an efficient encoding of a Nonogram
board as a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) through the use of
regular expressions in order to make our experiments feasible.
