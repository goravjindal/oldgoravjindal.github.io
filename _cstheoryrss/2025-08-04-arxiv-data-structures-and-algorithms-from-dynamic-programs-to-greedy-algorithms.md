We show for several computational problems how classical greedy algorithms
for special cases can be derived in a simple way from dynamic programs for the
general case: interval scheduling (restricted to unit weights), knapsack
(restricted to unit values), and shortest paths (restricted to nonnegative edge
lengths). Conceptually, we repeatedly expand the Bellman equations underlying
the dynamic program and use straightforward monotonicity properties to figure
out which terms yield the optimal value under the respective restrictions. The
approach offers an alternative for developing these greedy algorithms in
undergraduate algorithms courses and/or for arguing their correctness. In the
setting of interval scheduling, it elucidates the change in order from earliest
start time first for the memoized dynamic program to earliest finish time first
for the greedy algorithm.
