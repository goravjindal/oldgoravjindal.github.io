Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for
extracting robust and interpretable features from noisy high-dimensional data.
In the context of Social Choice Theory, where preference profiles and
collective decisions are geometrically rich yet sensitive to perturbations, TDA
remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel conceptual bridge
between these domains by proposing a new metric framework for persistence
diagrams tailored to noisy preference data.We define a polar coordinate-based
distance that captures both the magnitude and orientation of topological
features in a smooth and differentiable manner. Our metric addresses key
limitations of classical distances, such as bottleneck and Wasserstein,
including instability under perturbation, lack of continuity, and
incompatibility with gradient-based learning. The resulting formulation offers
improved behavior in both theoretical and applied settings.To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to systematically apply persistent homology
to social choice systems, providing a mathematically grounded method for
comparing topological summaries of voting structures and preference dynamics.
We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments,
including robustness tests and supervised learning tasks, and we propose a
modular pipeline for building predictive models from online preference data.
This work contributes a conceptually novel and computationally effective tool
to the emerging interface of topology and decision theory, opening new
directions in interpretable machine learning for political and economic
systems.
