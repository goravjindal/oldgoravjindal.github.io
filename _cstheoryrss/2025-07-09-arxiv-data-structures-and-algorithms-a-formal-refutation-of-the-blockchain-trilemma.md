The so-called blockchain trilemma asserts the impossibility of simultaneously
achieving scalability, security, and decentralisation within a single
blockchain protocol. In this paper, we formally refute that proposition.
Employing predicate logic, formal automata theory, computational complexity
analysis, and graph-theoretic measures of relay topology--specifically Baran's
model of network path redundancy--we demonstrate that the trilemma constitutes
a category error, conflates distinct analytical domains, and relies upon
unproven causal assumptions. We further expose its reliance on composition
fallacies drawn from flawed system implementations. A constructive
counterexample is presented: a blockchain protocol exhibiting unbounded
transaction throughput, cryptographic security under adversarial load, and
multipath decentralised propagation. This example is not hypothetical but
grounded in protocol design enabled by compact block relay, SPV verification,
and IPv6 multicast. The trilemma is revealed not as a law of protocol
architecture, but as a heuristic fallacy sustained by imprecision and design
defeatism.
