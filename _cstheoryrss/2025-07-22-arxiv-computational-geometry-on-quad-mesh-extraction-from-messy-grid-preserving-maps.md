Extracting a quad mesh from a grid preserving map is straightforward in
theory, but typical inputs are not exactly grid preserving maps. Previous works
can manage minor deviations from grid preserving maps, but without a clear
specification of what is acceptable. This work clarifies how typical inputs
differ from a grid preserving map, and shows how the differences with a grid
preserving map can be reflected by a sequence of operations acting on a
discrete structure. It opens research opportunities for the design of a robust
quad extraction algorithm.
