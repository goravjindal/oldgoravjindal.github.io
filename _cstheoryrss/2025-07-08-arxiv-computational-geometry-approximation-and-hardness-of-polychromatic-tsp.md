We introduce the Polychromatic Traveling Salesman Problem (PCTSP), where the
input is an edge weighted graph whose vertices are partitioned into $k$
equal-sized color classes, and the goal is to find a minimum-length Hamiltonian
cycle that visits the classes in a fixed cyclic order. This generalizes the
Bipartite TSP (when $k = 2$) and the classical TSP (when $k = n$). We give a
polynomial-time $(3 - 2 \* 10^{-36})$-approximation algorithm for metric PCTSP.
Complementing this, we show that Euclidean PCTSP is APX-hard even in $R^2$,
ruling out the existence of a PTAS unless P = NP.
