In this paper, we extend Busy Beaver function to a class of higher order Busy
Beaver functions based on Turing oracle machine. We prove some results about
the relation between decidability of number theoretical formula and higher
order Busy Beaver functions, and the relation between computability of max-min
partial recursive functions and higher order Busy Beaver functions. We also
present some conjectures on higher order Busy Beaver functions.
