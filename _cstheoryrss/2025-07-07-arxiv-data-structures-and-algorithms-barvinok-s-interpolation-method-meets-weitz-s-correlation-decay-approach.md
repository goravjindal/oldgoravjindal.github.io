In this paper we take inspiration from Weit'z algorithm for approximating the
independence polynomial to provide a new algorithm for computing the
coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithm of the independence
polynomial. Hereby we provide a clear connections between Barvinok's
interpolation method and Weitz's algorithm. Our algorithm easily extends to
other graph polynomials and partition functions and we illustrate this by
applying it to the chromatic polynomial and to the graph homomorphism partition
function. Our approach arguably yields a simpler and more transparent algorithm
than the algorithm of Patel and the second author.
As an application of our algorithmic approach we moreover derive, using the
interpolation method, a deterministic $O(n(m/\varepsilon)^{7})$-time algorithm
that on input of an $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph of minimum degree at least
$3$ and $\varepsilon>0$ approximately computes the number of sink-free
orientations of $G$ up to a multiplicative $\exp(\varepsilon)$ factor.
