We show that the max-min-angle polygon in a planar point set can be found in
time $O(n\log n)$ and a max-min-solid-angle convex polyhedron in a
three-dimensional point set can be found in time $O(n^2)$. We also study the
maxmin-angle polygonal curve in 3d, which we show to be $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to
find if repetitions are forbidden but can be found in near-cubic time if
repeated vertices or line segments are allowed, by reducing the problem to
finding a bottleneck cycle in a graph. We formalize a class of problems on
which a decremental greedy algorithm can be guaranteed to find an optimal
solution, generalizing our max-min-angle and bottleneck cycle algorithms,
together with a known algorithm for graph degeneracy.
