We consider an optimal stopping problem with n correlated offers where the
goal is to design a (randomized) stopping strategy that maximizes the expected
value of the offer in the sequence at which we stop. Instead of assuming to
know the complete correlation structure, which is unrealistic in practice, we
only assume to have knowledge of the distribution of the maximum value of the
sequence, and want to analyze the worst-case correlation structure whose
maximum follows this distribution. This can be seen as a trade-off between the
setting in which no distributional information is known, and the Bayesian
setting in which the (possibly correlated) distributions of all the individual
offers are known. As our first main result we show that a deterministic
threshold strategy using the monopoly price of the distribution of the maximum
value is asymptotically optimal assuming that the expectation of the maximum
value grows sublinearly in n. In our second main result, we further tighten
this bound by deriving a tight quadratic convergence guarantee for sufficiently
smooth distributions of the maximum value. Our results also give rise to a more
fine-grained picture regarding prophet inequalities with correlated values, for
which distribution-free bounds often only yield a performance guarantee that is
of the order 1/n.
