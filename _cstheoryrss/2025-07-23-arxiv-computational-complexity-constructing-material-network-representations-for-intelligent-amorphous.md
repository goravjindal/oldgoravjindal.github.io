Designing high-performance amorphous alloys is demanding for various
applications. But this process intensively relies on empirical laws and
unlimited attempts. The high-cost and low-efficiency nature of the traditional
strategies prevents effective sampling in the enormous material space. Here, we
propose material networks to accelerate the discovery of binary and ternary
amorphous alloys. The network topologies reveal hidden material candidates that
were obscured by traditional tabular data representations. By scrutinizing the
amorphous alloys synthesized in different years, we construct dynamical
material networks to track the history of the alloy discovery. We find that
some innovative materials designed in the past were encoded in the networks,
demonstrating their predictive power in guiding new alloy design. These
material networks show physical similarities with several real-world networks
in our daily lives. Our findings pave a new way for intelligent materials
design, especially for complex alloys.
