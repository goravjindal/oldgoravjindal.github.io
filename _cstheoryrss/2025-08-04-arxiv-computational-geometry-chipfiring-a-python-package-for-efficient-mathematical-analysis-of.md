This paper presents `chipfiring`, a comprehensive Python package for the
mathematical analysis of chip-firing games on finite graphs. The package
provides a robust toolkit for defining graphs and chip configurations
(divisors), performing chip-firing operations, and analyzing fundamental
properties such as winnability, linear equivalence, and divisor rank. We detail
the core components of the library, including its object-oriented graph and
divisor implementations, integrated Laplacian matrix computations, and an
efficient implementation of Dhar's algorithm for determining the solvability of
the dollar game. The `chipfiring` package is designed for researchers and
students in graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, providing
essential algorithms and data structures for exploring these rich mathematical
models. We describe the library's architecture, illustrate its usage with
comprehensive examples, and highlight its specialized contributions compared to
general-purpose graph libraries.
