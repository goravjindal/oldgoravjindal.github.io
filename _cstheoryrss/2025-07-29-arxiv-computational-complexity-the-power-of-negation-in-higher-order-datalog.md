We investigate the expressive power of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ under both
the well-founded and the stable model semantics, establishing tight connections
with complexity classes. We prove that under the well-founded semantics, for
all $k\geq 1$, $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP, a result that holds
without explicit ordering of the input database. The proof of this fact can be
performed either by using the powerful existential predicate variables of the
language or by using partially applied relations and relation enumeration.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this expressive power is retained within a
stratified fragment of the language. Under the stable model semantics, we show
that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures co-(k-NEXP) using cautious reasoning
and k-NEXP using brave reasoning, again with analogous results for the
stratified fragment augmented with choice rules. Our results establish a
hierarchy of expressive power, highlighting an interesting trade-off between
order and non-determinism in the context of higher-order logic programming:
increasing the order of programs under the well-founded semantics can surpass
the expressive power of lower-order programs under the stable model semantics.
