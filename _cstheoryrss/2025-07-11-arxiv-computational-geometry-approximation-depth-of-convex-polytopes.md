We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing
polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we
study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given
depth. Our main results imply that simplices can only be ``trivially
approximated''. On the way, we obtain a characterization of simplices as the
only ``outer additive'' convex bodies.
