Quantum hashing is a useful technique that allows us to construct
memory-efficient algorithms and secure quantum protocols. First, we present a
circuit that implements the phase form of quantum hashing using $2^{n-1}$ CNOT
gates, where n is the number of control qubits. Our method outperforms existing
approaches and reduces the circuit depth. Second, we propose an algorithm that
provides a trade-off between the number of CNOT gates (and consequently, the
circuit depth) and the precision of rotation angles. This is particularly
important in the context of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices,
where hardware-imposed angle precision limit remains a critical constraint.
