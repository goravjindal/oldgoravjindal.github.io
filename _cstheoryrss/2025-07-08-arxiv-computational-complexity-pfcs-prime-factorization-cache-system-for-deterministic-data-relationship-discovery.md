Cache systems fundamentally limit modern computing performance due to their
inability to precisely capture data relationships. While achieving 85-92% hit
rates, traditional systems rely on statistical heuristics that cannot guarantee
relationship discovery, leading to suboptimal prefetching and resource waste.
We present PFCS (Prime Factorization Cache System), which leverages the
mathematical uniqueness of prime factorization to achieve deterministic
relationship discovery with zero false positives. PFCS assigns unique primes to
data elements and represents relationships as composite numbers, enabling the
recovery of perfect relationships through factorization. A comprehensive
evaluation across database, ML, and HPC workloads demonstrates an average
performance improvement of x 6.2, 98.9% hit rates, and a 38% power reduction
compared to state-of-the-art systems. The mathematical foundation provides
formal guarantees impossible with approximation-based approaches, establishing
a new paradigm for cache system design
