We define a class of $C^k$-regular surfaces, $k \geq 1$, \emph{tileable
surfaces}, that admit geometric tilings by a finite number of congruence
classes of tiles. We show how to construct many examples, and examine the
relationship with the well known tilings of the plane and sphere, as well as
monohedral polyhedral surfaces.
