As an important metric for mesh quality evaluation, the isotropy property
holds significant value for applications such as texture UV-mapping, physical
simulation, and discrete geometric analysis. Classical isotropy remeshing
methods adjust vertices and edge lengths, which exhibit certain limitations in
terms of input data sensitivity, geometric consistency control, and convergence
speed. In this paper, we propose an improved isotropy remeshing solution with
inter-angle optimization during mesh editing to enhance shape control
capability and accelerate convergence. The advantage of the solution lies in
its ability to predict the impact of edge length adjustments on subsequent
optimization by monitoring angle transformations. It avoids inefficient editing
that may cause performance fluctuations, thereby improving efficiency.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the
overall efficiency of mesh optimization.
