Linear automata are automata with two reading heads starting from the two
extremes of the input, are equivalent to 5' -> 3' Watson-Crick (WK) finite
automata. The heads read the input in opposite directions and the computation
finishes when the heads meet. These automata accept the class LIN of linear
languages. The deterministic counterpart of these models, on the one hand, is
less expressive, as only a proper subset of LIN, the class 2detLIN is accepted;
and on the other hand, they are also equivalent in the sense of the class of
the accepted languages. Now, based on these automata models, we characterize
the class of 2detLIN languages with a Myhill-Nerode type of equivalence
classes. However, as these automata may do the computation of both the prefix
and the suffix of the input, we use prefix-suffix pairs in our classes.
Additionally, it is proven that finitely many classes in the characterization
match with the 2detLIN languages, but we have some constraints on the used
prefix-suffix pairs, i.e., the characterization should have the property to be
complete and it must not have any crossing pairs.
