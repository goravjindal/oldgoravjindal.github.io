Given a point set, mostly a grid in our case, we seek upper and lower bounds
on the number of curves that are needed to cover the point set. We say a curve
covers a point if the curve passes through the point. We consider such
coverings by monotonic curves, lines, orthoconvex curves, circles, etc. We also
study a problem that is converse of the covering problem -- if a set of $n^2$
points in the plane is covered by $n$ lines then can we say something about the
configuration of the points?
