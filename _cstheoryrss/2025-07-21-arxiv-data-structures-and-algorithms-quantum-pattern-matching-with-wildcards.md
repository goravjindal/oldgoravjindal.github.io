Pattern matching is one of the fundamental problems in Computer Science. Both
the classic version of the problem as well as the more sophisticated version
where wildcards can also appear in the input can be solved in almost linear
time $\tilde O(n)$ using the KMP algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform,
respectively. In 2000, Ramesh and Vinay~\cite{ramesh2003string} give a quantum
algorithm that solves classic pattern matching in sublinear time and asked
whether the wildcard problem can also be solved in sublinear time? In this
work, we give a quantum algorithm for pattern matching with wildcards that runs
in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{n}\sqrt{k})$ when the number of wildcards is bounded by
$k$ for $k \geq \sqrt{n}$. This leads to an algorithm that runs in sublinear
time as long as the number of wildcards is sublinear.
