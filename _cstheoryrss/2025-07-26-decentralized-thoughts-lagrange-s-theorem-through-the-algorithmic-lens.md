Groups lie at the heart of many cryptographic constructions. In this post, we revisit the classic Lagrange’s theorem through a more algorithmic lens. Largange’s theorem is a simple structure theorem that will be useful for many more advanced results. Recall that a group is a non-empty set $G$ and a...
