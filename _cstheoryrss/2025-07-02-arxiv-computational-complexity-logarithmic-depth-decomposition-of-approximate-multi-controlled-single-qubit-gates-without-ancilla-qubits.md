The synthesis of quantum operators involves decomposing general quantum gates
into the gate set supported by a given quantum device. Multi-controlled gates
are essential components in this process. In this work, we present improved
decompositions of multi-controlled NOT gates with logarithmic depth using a
single ancilla qubit, while also reducing the constant factors in the circuit
depth compared to previous work. We optimize a previously proposed
decomposition of multi-target, multi-controlled special unitary SU(2) gates by
identifying the presence of a conditionally clean qubit. Additionally, we
introduce the best-known decomposition of multi-controlled approximate unitary
U(2) gates without using ancilla qubits. This approach significantly reduces
the overall circuit depth and CNOT count while preserving an adjustable error
parameter, yielding a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing
large controlled-unitary gates. Our method is particularly suitable for both
NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum architectures. All software developed in this
project is freely available.
