Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally
analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we
focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers)
combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy
parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all
interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded
(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different
ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the
saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.
Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer
concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers
are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even
if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper
bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial
arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to
real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to
decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new
framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when
configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.
