In 1981, Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] conjectured that given a
set system $A \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ with degree at most $k$ (i.e., each
column of $A$ has at most $k$ non-zeros), its combinatorial discrepancy
$\mathsf{disc}(A) := \min\_{x \in \{\pm 1\}^n} \|Ax\|\_\infty$ is at most
$O(\sqrt{k})$. Previously, the best-known bounds for this conjecture were
either $O(k)$, first established by Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981],
or $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$, first proved by Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor.,
1998].
We give an algorithmic proof of an improved bound of $O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$
whenever $k \geq \log^5 n$, thus matching the Beck-Fiala conjecture up to
$O(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ for almost the full regime of $k$.
