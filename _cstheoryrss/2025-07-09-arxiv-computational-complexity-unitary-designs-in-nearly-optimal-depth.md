We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in
circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is
exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$,
$\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to
exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla
qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n
k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count
$\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To
achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured
random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth
implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new
analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many
queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's
versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of
pseudorandom unitaries.
