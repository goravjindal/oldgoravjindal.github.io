Local differential privacy represents the gold standard for preserving the
privacy of data before it leaves the device, and distribution estimation under
this model has been well studied. Recently, protocols built upon balanced
incomplete block designs were shown to achieve optimal error for this problem.
However, it remained unknown whether other constructions could also be optimal.
We resolve this question by proving that any protocol achieving optimal error
must correspond to some balanced incomplete block design. This result, combined
with prior work, completely characterises the set of optimal protocols for this
problem. As a consequence, the protocols that achieve optimal error and optimal
communication are only those based on symmetrical balanced incomplete block
designs.
