We show that approximating the trace norm contraction coefficient of a
quantum channel within a constant factor is NP-hard. Equivalently, this shows
that determining the optimal success probability for encoding a bit in a
quantum system undergoing noise is NP-hard. This contrasts with the classical
analogue of this problem that can clearly by solved efficiently. Our hardness
results also hold for deciding if the contraction coefficient is equal to 1. As
a consequence, we show that deciding if a non-commutative graph has an
independence number of at least 2 is NP-hard. In addition, we establish a
converging hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds on the
contraction coefficient.
