A bipartite graph $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar graph if it
admits a drawing on the plane such that the vertices in $X$ and $Y$ are placed
on two parallel lines respectively, edges are drawn as straight-line segments,
and every edge involves at most $k$ crossings. Angelini, Da Lozzo, F\"orster,
and Schneck [GD 2020; Comput. J., 2024] showed that every 2-layer $k$-planar
graph has pathwidth at most $k + 1$. In this paper, we show that this bound is
sharp by giving a 2-layer $k$-planar graph with pathwidth $k + 1$ for every $k
\geq 0$. This improves their lower bound of $(k+3)/2$.
