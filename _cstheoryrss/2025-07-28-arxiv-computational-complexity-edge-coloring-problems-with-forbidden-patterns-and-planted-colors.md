Edge-coloring problems with forbidden patterns refer to decision problems
whose input is a graph $\mathbb G$ and where the goal is to determine whether
the edges of $\mathbb G$ can be colored (with a fixed finite set of colors) in
a way that in the resulting colored graph $(\mathbb G, \xi)$, none of a fixed
set of edge-colored obstructions admits a homomorphism to $(\mathbb G, \xi)$.
In the coloring extension setting, some of the edges of $\mathbb G$ are already
colored and the goal is to find an extension of this coloring omitting the
obstructions. We show that for certain sets of obstructions, there is a
polynomial-time equivalence between the coloring problem and the extension
problem. We also show that for natural sets of obstructions, such coloring
problems exhibit a P vs. NP-complete complexity dichotomy.
