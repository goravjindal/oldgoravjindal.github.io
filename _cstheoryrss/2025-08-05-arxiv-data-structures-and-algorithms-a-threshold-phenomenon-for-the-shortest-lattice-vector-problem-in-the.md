One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest
vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a
non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and
work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries
and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that
this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest
absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The
algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a
threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value
determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity
norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In
particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given
polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.
