Translational tiling problems are among the most fundamental and
representative undecidable problems in all fields of mathematics. Greenfeld and
Tao obtained two remarkable results on the undecidability of translational
tiling in recent years. One is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in a
space of sufficiently large dimension. The other is the undecidability of
translational tiling of periodic subsets of space with a single tile, provided
that the dimension of the space is part of the input. These two results support
the following conjecture: there is a fixed dimension $n$ such that
translational tiling with a single tile is undecidable. One strategy towards
solving this conjecture is to prove the undecidability of translational tiling
of a fixed dimension space with a set of $k$ tiles, for a positive integer $k$
as small as possible. In this paper, it is shown that translational tiling the
$3$-dimensional space with a set of $3$ polycubes is undecidable.
