In the paper where he first defined Communication Complexity, Yao asks:
\emph{Is computing $CC(f)$ (the 2-way communication complexity of a given
function $f$) NP-complete?} The problem of deciding whether $CC(f) \le k$, when
given the communication matrix for $f$ and a number $k$, is easily seen to be
in NP. Kushilevitz and Weinreb have shown that this problem is
cryptographically hard. Here we show it is NP-hard.
