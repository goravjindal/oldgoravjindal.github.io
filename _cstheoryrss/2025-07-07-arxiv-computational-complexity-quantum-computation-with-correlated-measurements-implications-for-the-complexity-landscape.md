In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$
($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to
$\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class,
$\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to
perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value
across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly
equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$.
In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such
as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary
quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore,
we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries.
In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy
($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we
introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity
of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.
