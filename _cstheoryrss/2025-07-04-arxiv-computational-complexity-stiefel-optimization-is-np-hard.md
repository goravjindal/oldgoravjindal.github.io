We show that linearly constrained linear optimization over a Stiefel or
Grassmann manifold is NP-hard in general. We show that the same is true for
unconstrained quadratic optimization over a Stiefel manifold. We will establish
the nonexistence of FPTAS for these optimization problems over a Stiefel
manifold. As an aside we extend our results to flag manifolds. Combined with
earlier findings, this shows that manifold optimization is a difficult endeavor
-- even the simplest problems like LP and unconstrained QP are already NP-hard
on the most common manifolds.
