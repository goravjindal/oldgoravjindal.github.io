When an old apartment building is demolished and rebuilt, how can we fairly
redistribute the new apartments to minimize envy among residents? We reduce
this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the \*Min Max
Average Cycle Weight\* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to
agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in
an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching
when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we
show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such
as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem
is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open
problem.
