We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on monotone systems. For
monotone systems satisfying the entropic independence condition, we prove a new
mixing time comparison result for Glauber dynamics. For concrete applications,
we obtain $\tilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the random cluster model induced by
the ferromagnetic Ising model with consistently biased external fields, and
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$ mixing time for the bipartite hardcore model under the
one-sided uniqueness condition, where $n$ is the number of variables in
corresponding models, improving the best known results in [Chen and Zhang,
SODA'23] and [Chen, Liu, and Yin, FOCS'23], respectively.
Our proof combines ideas from the stochastic dominance argument in the
classical censoring inequality and the recently developed high-dimensional
expanders. The key step in the proof is a novel comparison result between the
Glauber dynamics and the field dynamics for monotone systems.
