We study the fair division of indivisible items and provide new insights into
the EFX problem, which is widely regarded as the central open question in fair
division, and the PMMS problem, a strictly stronger variant of EFX. Our first
result constructs a three-agent instance with two monotone valuations and one
additive valuation in which no PMMS allocation exists. Since EFX allocations
are known to exist under these assumptions, this establishes a formal
separation between EFX and PMMS.
We prove existence of fair allocations for three important special cases. We
show that EFX allocations exist for personalized bivalued valuations, where for
each agent $i$ there exist values $a\_i > b\_i$ such that agent $i$ assigns value
$v\_i(\{g\}) \in \{a\_i, b\_i\}$ to each good $g$. We establish an analogous
existence result for PMMS allocations when $a\_i$ is divisible by $b\_i$. We also
prove that PMMS allocations exist for binary-valued MMS-feasible valuations,
where each bundle $S$ has value $v\_i(S) \in \{0, 1\}$. Notably, this result
holds even without assuming monotonicity of valuations and thus applies to the
fair division of chores and mixed manna. Finally, we study a class of
valuations called pair-demand valuations, which extend the well-studied
unit-demand valuations to the case where each agent derives value from at most
two items, and we show that PMMS allocations exist in this setting. Our proofs
are constructive, and we provide polynomial-time algorithms for all three
existence results.
