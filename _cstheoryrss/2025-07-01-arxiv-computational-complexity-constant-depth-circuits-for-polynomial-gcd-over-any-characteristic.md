We show that the GCD of two univariate polynomials can be computed by
(piece-wise) algebraic circuits of constant depth and polynomial size over any
sufficiently large field, regardless of the characteristic. This extends a
recent result of Andrews & Wigderson who showed such an upper bound over fields
of zero or large characteristic.
Our proofs are based on a recent work of Bhattacharjee, Kumar, Rai,
Ramanathan, Saptharishi \& Saraf that shows closure of constant depth algebraic
circuits under factorization. On our way to the proof, we show that any
$n$-variate symmetric polynomial $P$ that has a small constant depth algebraic
circuit can be written as the composition of a small constant depth algebraic
circuit with elementary symmetric polynomials. This statement is a constant
depth version of a result of Bl\"{a}ser & Jindal, who showed this for algebraic
circuits of unbounded depth. As an application of our techniques, we also
strengthen the closure results for factors of constant-depth circuits in the
work of Bhattacharjee et al. over fields for small characteristic.
