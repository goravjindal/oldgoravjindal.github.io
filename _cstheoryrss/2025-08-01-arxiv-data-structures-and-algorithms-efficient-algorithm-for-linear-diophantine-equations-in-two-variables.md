Solving linear diophantine equations in two variables have applications in
computer science and mathematics. In this paper, we revisit an algorithm for
solving linear diophantine equations in two variables, which we refer as DEA-R
algorithm. The DEA-R algorithm always incurs equal or less number of recursions
or recursive calls as compared to extended euclidean algorithm. With the
objective of taking advantage of the less number of recursive calls , we
propose an optimized version of the DEA-R algorithm as DEA-OPTD. In the
recursive function calls in DEA-OPTD, we propose a sequence of more efficient
computations. We do a theoretical comparison of the execution times of DEA-OPTD
algorithm and DEA-R algorithm to find any possible bound on the value of $c$
for DEA-OPTD being better than DEA-R. We implement and compare an iterative
version of DEA-OPTD (DEA-OPTDI) with two versions of a widely used algorithm on
an specific input setting. In this comparison, we find out that our algorithm
outperforms on the other algorithm against atleast 96% of the inputs.
