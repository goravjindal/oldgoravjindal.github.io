We present a $0.659$-competitive Quadratic Ranking algorithm for the
Oblivious Bipartite Matching problem, a distribution-free version of
Query-Commit Matching. This result breaks the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier,
addressing an open question raised by Tang, Wu, and Zhang (JACM 2023).
Moreover, the competitive ratio of this distribution-free algorithm improves
the best existing $0.641$ ratio for Query-Commit Matching achieved by the
distribution-dependent algorithm of Chen, Huang, Li, and Tang (SODA 2025).
Quadratic Ranking is a novel variant of the classic Ranking algorithm. We
parameterize the algorithm with two functions, and let two key expressions in
the definition and analysis of the algorithm be quadratic forms of the two
functions. We show that the quadratic forms are the unique choices that satisfy
a set of natural properties. Further, they allow us to optimize the choice of
the two functions using powerful quadratic programming solvers.
