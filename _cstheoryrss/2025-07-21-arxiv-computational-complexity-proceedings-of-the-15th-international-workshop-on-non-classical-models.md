The Fifteenth International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and
Applications (NCMA 2025) was held in Loughborough, UK, on July 21 and 22, 2025,
organized by the Department of Computer Science at Loughborough University and
co-located with the 26th International Conference on Descriptional Complexity
of Formal Systems (DCFS 2025, 22-24 July).
The NCMA workshop series was established in 2009 as an annual event for
researchers working on non-classical and classical models of automata, grammars
or related devices. Such models are investigated both as theoretical models and
as formal models for applications from various points of view. The goal of the
NCMA workshop series is to exchange and develop novel ideas in order to gain
deeper and interdisciplinary coverage of this particular area that may foster
new insights and substantial progress.
