This paper introduces a novel stability measure for edit distances between
merge trees of piecewise linear scalar fields. We apply the new measure to
various metrics introduced recently in the field of scalar field comparison in
scientific visualization. While previous stability measures are unable to
capture the fine-grained hierarchy of the considered distances, we obtain a
classification of stability that fits the efficiency of current implementations
and quality of practical results. Our results induce several open questions
regarding the lacking theoretical analysis of such practical distances.
