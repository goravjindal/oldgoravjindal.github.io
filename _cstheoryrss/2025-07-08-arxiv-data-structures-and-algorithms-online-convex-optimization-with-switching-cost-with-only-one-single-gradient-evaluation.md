Online convex optimization with switching cost is considered under the frugal
information setting where at time $t$, before action $x\_t$ is taken, only a
single function evaluation and a single gradient is available at the previously
chosen action $x\_{t-1}$ for either the current cost function $f\_t$ or the most
recent cost function $f\_{t-1}$. When the switching cost is linear, online
algorithms with optimal order-wise competitive ratios are derived for the
frugal setting. When the gradient information is noisy, an online algorithm
whose competitive ratio grows quadratically with the noise magnitude is
derived.
