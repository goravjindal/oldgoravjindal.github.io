Online social networks have become an integral part of modern society,
profoundly influencing how individuals form and exchange opinions across
diverse domains ranging from politics to public health. The Friedkin-Johnsen
model serves as a foundational framework for modeling opinion formation
dynamics in such networks. In this paper, we address the computational task of
efficiently determining the equilibrium opinion vector and associated metrics
including polarization and disagreement, applicable to both directed and
undirected social networks. We propose a deterministic local algorithm with
relative error guarantees, scaling to networks exceeding ten million nodes.
Further acceleration is achieved through integration with successive
over-relaxation techniques, where a relaxation factor optimizes convergence
rates. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world networks validate the
practical effectiveness of our approaches, demonstrating significant
improvements in computational efficiency and scalability compared to
conventional methods.
