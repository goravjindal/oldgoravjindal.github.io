In the Cumulative Vehicle Routing Problem (Cu-VRP), we need to find a
feasible itinerary for a capacitated vehicle located at the depot to satisfy
customers' demand, as in the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), but the
goal is to minimize the cumulative cost of the vehicle, which is based on the
vehicle's load throughout the itinerary. If the demand of each customer is
unknown until the vehicle visits it, the problem is called Cu-VRP with
Stochastic Demands (Cu-VRPSD). Assume that the approximation ratio of metric
TSP is $1.5$. In this paper, we propose a randomized $3.456$-approximation
algorithm for Cu-VRPSD, improving the best-known approximation ratio of $6$
(Discret. Appl. Math. 2020). Since VRP with Stochastic Demands (VRPSD) is a
special case of Cu-VRPSD, as a corollary, we also obtain a randomized
$3.25$-approximation algorithm for VRPSD, improving the best-known
approximation ratio of $3.5$ (Oper. Res. 2012). For Cu-VRP, we give a
randomized $3.194$-approximation algorithm, improving the best-known
approximation ratio of $4$ (Oper. Res. Lett. 2013). Moreover, if each customer
is allowed to be satisfied by using multiple tours, we obtain further
improvements for Cu-VRPSD and Cu-VRP.
