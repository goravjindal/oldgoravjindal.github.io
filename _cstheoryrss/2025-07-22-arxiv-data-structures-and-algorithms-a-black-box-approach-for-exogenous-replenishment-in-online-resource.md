In a typical online resource allocation problem, we start with a fixed
inventory of resources and make online allocation decisions in response to
resource requests that arrive sequentially over a finite horizon. We consider
settings where the inventory is replenished over time according to an unknown
exogenous process. We introduce black-box methods that extend any existing
algorithm, originally designed without considering replenishment, into one that
works with an arbitrary (adversarial or stochastic) replenishment process. Our
approach preserves the original algorithm's competitive ratio in regimes with
large initial inventory, thereby enabling the seamless integration of exogenous
replenishment into a large body of existing algorithmic results for both
adversarial and stochastic arrival models.
