A seminal result of Nisan and Szegedy (STOC, 1992) shows that for any total
Boolean function, the degree of the real polynomial that computes the function,
and the minimal degree of a real polynomial that point-wise approximates the
function, are at most polynomially separated. Extending this result from degree
to other complexity measures like sparsity of the polynomial representation, or
total weight of the coefficients, remains poorly understood.
In this work, we consider this problem in the De Morgan basis, and prove an
analogous result for the sparsity of the polynomials at a logarithmic scale.
Our result further implies that the exact $\ell\_1$ norm and its approximate
variant are also similarly related to each other at a log scale. This is in
contrast to the Fourier basis, where the analog of our results are known to be
false.
Our proof is based on a novel random restriction method. Unlike most existing
random restriction methods used in complexity theory, our random restriction
process is adaptive and is based on how various complexity measures simplify
during the restriction process.
