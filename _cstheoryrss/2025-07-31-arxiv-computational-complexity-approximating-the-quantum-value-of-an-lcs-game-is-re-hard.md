We generalize H\r{a}stad's long-code test for projection games and show that
it remains complete and sound against entangled provers.
Combined with a result of Dong et al. \cite{Dong25}, which establishes that
$\MIP^\*=\RE$ with constant-length answers, we derive that
$\LIN^\*\_{1-\epsilon,s}=\RE$, for some $1/2< s<1$ and for every sufficiently
small $\epsilon>0$, where LIN refers to linearity (over $\mathbb{F}\_2$) of the
verifier predicate. Achieving the same result with $\epsilon=0$ would imply the
existence of a non-hyperlinear group.
