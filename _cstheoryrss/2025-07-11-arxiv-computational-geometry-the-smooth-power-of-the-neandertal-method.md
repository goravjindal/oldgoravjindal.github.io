We describe an algorithmic method to transform a Euclidean wallpaper pattern
into a Circle Limit-style picture \`a la Escher. The design goals for the
method are to be mathematically sound, aesthetically pleasing and fast to
compute. It turns out that a certain class of conformal maps is particularly
well-suited for the problem. Moreover, in our specific application, a very
simple method, sometimes jokingly called the "Neandertal Method" for its almost
brutal simplicity, proves to be highly efficient, as it can easily be
parallelized to be run on the GPU, unlike many other approaches.
