In this paper, we characterize the classes of languages and functions that
are low for counting function classes. The classes #P and GapP have their low
classes exactly characterized: Low(#P) = UP $\cap$ coUP and Low(GapP) = SPP. We
prove that Low(TotP) = P, Low(SpanP) = NP $\cap$ coNP, and give
characterizations of low function classes for #P, GapP, TotP, and SpanP. We
establish the relations between NPSVt, UPSVt, and the counting function
classes. For each of the inclusions between these classes we give an equivalent
inclusion between language classes. We also prove that SpanP $\subseteq$ GapP
if and only if NP $\subseteq$ SPP, and the inclusion GapP+ $\subseteq$ SpanP
implies PH = $\Sigma\_{2}^{P}$. For the classes #P, GapP, TotP, and SpanP we
summarize the known results and prove that each of these classes is closed
under left composition with FP+ if and only if it collapses to its low class of
functions.
