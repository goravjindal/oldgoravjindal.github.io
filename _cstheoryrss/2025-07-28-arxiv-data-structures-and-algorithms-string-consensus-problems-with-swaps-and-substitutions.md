String consensus problems aim at finding a string that minimizes some given
distance with respect to an input set of strings. In particular, in the
\textsc{Closest String} problem, we are given a set of strings of equal length
and a radius $d$. The objective is to find a new string that differs from each
input string by at most $d$ substitutions. We study a generalization of this
problem where, in addition to substitutions, swaps of adjacent characters are
also permitted, each operation incurring a unit cost. Amir et al. showed that
this generalized problem is NP-hard, even when only swaps are allowed. In this
paper, we show that it is FPT with respect to the parameter $d$. Moreover, we
investigate a variant in which the goal is to minimize the sum of distances
from the output string to all input strings. For this version, we present a
polynomial-time algorithm.
