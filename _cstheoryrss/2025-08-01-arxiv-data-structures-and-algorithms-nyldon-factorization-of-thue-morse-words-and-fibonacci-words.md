The Nyldon factorization is a string factorization that is a non-decreasing
product of Nyldon words. Nyldon words and Nyldon factorizations are recently
defined combinatorial objects inspired by the well-known Lyndon words and
Lyndon factorizations. In this paper, we investigate the Nyldon factorization
of several words. First, we fully characterize the Nyldon factorizations of the
(finite) Fibonacci and the (finite) Thue-Morse words. Moreover, we show that
there exists a non-decreasing product of Nyldon words that is a factorization
of the infinite Thue-Morse word.
