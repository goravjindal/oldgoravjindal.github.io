We give a very general and simple framework to incorporate predictions on
requests for online covering problems in a rigorous and black-box manner. Our
framework turns any online algorithm with competitive ratio $\rho(k, \cdot)$
depending on $k$, the number of arriving requests, into an algorithm with
competitive ratio of $\rho(\eta, \cdot)$, where $\eta$ is the prediction error.
With accurate enough prediction, the resulting competitive ratio breaks through
the corresponding worst-case online lower bounds, and smoothly degrades as the
prediction error grows. This framework directly applies to a wide range of
well-studied online covering problems such as facility location, Steiner
problems, set cover, parking permit, etc., and yields improved and novel
bounds.
