The consensus problem, briefly stated, consists of having processes in an
asynchronous distributed system agree on a value. It is widely known that the
consensus problem does not have a deterministic solution that ensures both
termination and consistency, if there is at least one faulty process in the
system. This result, known as the FLP impossibility theorem, led to several
generalizations and developments in theoretical distributed computing. This
paper argues that the FLP impossibility theorem holds even under a generalized
definition of computation through oracles. Furthermore, using a theoretical
machinery from complex systems, this paper also posits that inconsistency may
be an emergent feature of consensus over distributed systems by examining how a
system transitions phases. Under the same complex systems framework, this paper
examines paraconsistent logics, arguing that while inconsistency is not an
emergent feature for these logics, triviality may be. Lastly, some attention is
given to the possibility of developing consensus algorithms capable of
paraconsistent reasoning.
