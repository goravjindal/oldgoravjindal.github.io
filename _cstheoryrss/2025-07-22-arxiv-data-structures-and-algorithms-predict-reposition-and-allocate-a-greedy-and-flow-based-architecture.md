The rapid proliferation of food delivery platforms has reshaped urban
mobility but has also contributed significantly to environmental degradation
through increased greenhouse gas emissions. Existing optimization mechanisms
produce sub-optimal outcomes as they do not consider environmental
sustainability their optimization objective. This study proposes a novel
eco-friendly food delivery optimization framework that integrates demand
prediction, delivery person routing, and order allocation to minimize
environmental impact while maintaining service efficiency. Since recommending
routes is NP-Hard, the proposed approach utilizes the submodular and monotone
properties of the objective function and designs an efficient greedy
optimization algorithm. Thereafter, it formulates order allocation problem as a
network flow optimization model, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not
been explored in the context of food delivery. A three-layered network
architecture is designed to match orders with delivery personnel based on
capacity constraints and spatial demand. Through this framework, the proposed
approach reduces the vehicle count, and creates a sustainable food delivery
ecosystem.
