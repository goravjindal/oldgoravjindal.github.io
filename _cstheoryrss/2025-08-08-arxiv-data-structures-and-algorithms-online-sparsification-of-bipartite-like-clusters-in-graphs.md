Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive
graphs, and has been widely applied in many research fields of data science.
While the objective of most graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex set
of low conductance, a sequence of recent studies highlights the importance of
the inter-connection between vertex sets when analysing real-world datasets.
Following this line of research, in this work we study bipartite-like clusters
and present efficient and online sparsification algorithms that find such
clusters in both undirected graphs and directed ones. We conduct experimental
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that our algorithms
significantly speedup the running time of existing clustering algorithms while
preserving their effectiveness.
