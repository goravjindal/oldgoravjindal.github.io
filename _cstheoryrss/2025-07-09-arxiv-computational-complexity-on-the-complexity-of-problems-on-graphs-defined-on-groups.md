We study the complexity of graph problems on graphs defined on groups,
especially power graphs. We observe that an isomorphism invariant problem, such
as Hamiltonian Path, Partition into Cliques, Feedback Vertex Set, Subgraph
Isomorphism, cannot be NP-complete for power graphs, commuting graphs, enhanced
power graphs, directed power graphs, and bounded-degree Cayley graphs, assuming
the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). An analogous result holds for
isomorphism invariant group problems: no such problem can be NP-complete unless
ETH is false. We show that the Weighted Max-Cut problem is NP-complete in power
graphs. We also show that, unless ETH is false, the Graph Motif problem cannot
be solved in quasipolynomial time on power graphs, even for power graphs of
cyclic groups. We study the recognition problem of power graphs when the
adjacency matrix or list is given as input and show that for abelian groups and
some classes of nilpotent groups, it is solvable in polynomial time.
