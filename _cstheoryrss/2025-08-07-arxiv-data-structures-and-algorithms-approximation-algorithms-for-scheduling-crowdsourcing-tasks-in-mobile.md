This paper addresses the scheduling problem in mobile social networks. We
begin by proving that the approximation ratio analysis presented in the paper
by Zhang \textit{et al.} (IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 2025) is
incorrect, and we provide the correct analysis results. Furthermore, when the
required service time for a task exceeds the total contact time between the
requester and the crowd worker, we demonstrate that the approximation ratio of
the Largest-Ratio-First task scheduling algorithm can reach $2 - \frac{1}{m}$.
Next, we introduce a randomized approximation algorithm to minimize mobile
social networks' total weighted completion time. This algorithm achieves an
expected approximation ratio of $1.5 + \epsilon$ for $\epsilon>0$. Finally, we
present a deterministic approximation algorithm that minimizes mobile social
networks' total weighted completion time. This deterministic algorithm achieves
an approximation ratio of $\max\left\{2.5,1+\epsilon\right\}$ for $\epsilon>0$.
Additionally, when the task's required service time or the total contact time
between the requester and the crowd worker is sufficiently large, this
algorithm can reach an approximation ratio of $1.5+\epsilon$ for $\epsilon>0$.
