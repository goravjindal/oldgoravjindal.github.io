We study vertex sparsification for preserving distances in planar graphs.
Given an edge-weighted planar graph with $k$ terminals, the goal is to
construct an emulator, which is a smaller edge-weighted planar graph that
contains the terminals and exactly preserves the pairwise distances between
them. We construct exact planar emulators of size $O(f^2k^2)$ in the setting
where terminals lie on $f$ faces in the planar embedding of the input graph.
Our result generalizes and interpolates between the previous results of Chang
and Ophelders and Goranci, Henzinger, and Peng which is an $O(k^2)$ bound in
the setting where all terminals lie on a single face (i.e., $f=1$), and the
result of Krauthgamer, Nguyen, and Zondiner, which is an $O(k^4)$ bound for the
general case (i.e., $f=k$).
Our construction follows a recent new way of analyzing graph structures, by
viewing graphs as paths and their intersections, which we believe is of
independent interest.
