The Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem states that for any sequence of $2n-1$
integers, there exists a subsequence of $n$ elements whose sum is divisible by
$n$. In this article, we provide a simple, practical $O(n\log\log n)$ algorithm
and a theoretical $O(n\log\log\log n)$ algorithm, both of which improve upon
the best previously known $O(n\log n)$ approach. This shows that a specific
variant of boolean convolution can be implemented in time faster than the usual
$O(n\log n)$ expected from FFT-based methods.
