We present a parallel variant of Pruned Landmark Labelling (PLL) that is
optimised for the preprocessing of hub labels on directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs). This method was developed during a seminar at the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology (KIT), focusing on time-expanded graphs that model public
transport networks. The approach leverages the topological properties of DAGs
to enable a novel parallel construction of hub labels.
