We present a polynomial-time $(\alpha\_{GW} + \varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the Maximum Cut problem on interval graphs and split graphs,
where $\alpha\_{GW} \approx 0.878$ is the approximation guarantee of the
Goemans-Williamson algorithm and $\varepsilon > 10^{-34}$ is a fixed constant.
To attain this, we give an improved analysis of a slight modification of the
Goemans-Williamson algorithm for graphs in which triangles can be packed into a
constant fraction of their edges. We then pair this analysis with structural
results showing that both interval graphs and split graphs either have such a
triangle packing or have maximum cut close to their number of edges. We also
show that, subject to the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, there exists a
constant $c > 0$ such that there is no polyomial-time $(1 - c)$-approximation
for Maximum Cut on split graphs.
