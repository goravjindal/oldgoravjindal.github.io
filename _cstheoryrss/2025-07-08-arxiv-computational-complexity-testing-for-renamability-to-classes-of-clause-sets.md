This paper investigates the problem of testing clause sets for membership in
classes known from literature. In particular, we are interested in classes
defined via renaming: Is it possible to rename the predicates in a way such
that positive and negative literals satisfy certain conditions? We show that
for classes like Horn or OCC1N, the existence of such renamings can be decided
in polynomial time, whereas the same problem is NP-complete for class PVD. The
decision procedures are based on hyper-resolution; if a renaming exists, it can
be extracted from the final saturated clause set.
