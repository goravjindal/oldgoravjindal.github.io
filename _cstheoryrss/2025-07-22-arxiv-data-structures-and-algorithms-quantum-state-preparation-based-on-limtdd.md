Quantum state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum computing and
quantum information processing. With the rapid advancement of quantum
technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly
important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation
based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD
combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling
efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the
state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates
substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum
states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples
indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential
efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the
potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust
theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum
computing technologies.
