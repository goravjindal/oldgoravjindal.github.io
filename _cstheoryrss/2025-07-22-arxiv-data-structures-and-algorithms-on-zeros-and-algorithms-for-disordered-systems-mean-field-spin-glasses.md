Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of
statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and
modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we
design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the
partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse
temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the
Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire
replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros
of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and
apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.
