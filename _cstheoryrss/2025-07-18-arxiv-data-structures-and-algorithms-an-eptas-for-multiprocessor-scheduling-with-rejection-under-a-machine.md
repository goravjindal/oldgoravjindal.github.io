We study the multiprocessor scheduling with rejection problem under a machine
cost constraint. In this problem, each job is either rejected with a rejection
penalty or; accepted and scheduled on one of the machines for processing. The
machine cost is proportional to the total processing time of the jobs scheduled
on it. The problem aims to minimize the makespan of accepted jobs plus the
total rejection penalty of rejected jobs while the total machine cost does not
exceed a given upper bound. We present a simple $2$-approximation algorithm for
the problem and we achieve an EPTAS when the number $m$ of machines is a fixed
constant.
