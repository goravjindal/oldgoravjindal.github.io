Minimally rigid graphs can be recognized and embedded in the plane efficiently, i.e. in polynomial time. There is also an efficient randomized parallel algorithm, i.e. in RNC. We present NC-algorithms to recognize whether one-crossing-minor-free graphs are minimally rigid. In the special case of $K\_{3,3}$-free graphs, we also compute an infinitesimally rigid embedding in NC.
