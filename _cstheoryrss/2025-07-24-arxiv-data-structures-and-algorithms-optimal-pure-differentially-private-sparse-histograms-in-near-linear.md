We introduce an algorithm that releases a pure differentially private sparse
histogram over $n$ participants drawn from a domain of size $d \gg n$. Our
method attains the optimal $\ell\_\infty$-estimation error and runs in strictly
$O(n \ln \ln d)$ time in the word-RAM model, thereby improving upon the
previous best known deterministic-time bound of $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and resolving
the open problem of breaking this quadratic barrier (Balcer and Vadhan, 2019).
Central to our algorithm is a novel private item blanket technique with
target-length padding, which transforms the approximate differentially private
stability-based histogram algorithm into a pure differentially private one.
