We study the problem of maximizing a monotone increasing submodular function
over a set of weighted elements subject to a knapsack constraint.
Although this problem is NP-hard, many applications require exact solutions,
as approximate solutions are often insufficient in practice.
To address this need, we propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm tailored
for the submodular knapsack problem and introduce several acceleration
techniques to enhance its efficiency. We evaluate these techniques on instances
of three benchmark problems and compare the proposed solvers to two solvers by
Sakaue and Ishihata, which are considered state-of-the-art, demonstrating that
the presented methods outperform the existing methods.
