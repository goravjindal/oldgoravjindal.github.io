Reconstructing models from unorganized point clouds presents a significant
challenge, especially when the models consist of multiple components
represented by their surface point clouds. Such models often involve point
clouds with noise that represent multiple closed surfaces with shared regions,
making their automatic identification and separation inherently complex. In
this paper, we propose an automatic method that uses the topological
understanding provided by persistent homology, along with representative
2-cycles of persistent homology groups, to effectively distinguish and separate
each closed surface. Furthermore, we employ Loop subdivision and least squares
progressive iterative approximation (LSPIA) techniques to generate high-quality
final surfaces and achieve complete model reconstruction. Our method is robust
to noise in the point cloud, making it suitable for reconstructing models from
such data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
and highlight its potential for practical applications.
