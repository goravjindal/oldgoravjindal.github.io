A cover (or quasiperiod) of a string $S$ is a shorter string $C$ such that
every position of $S$ is contained in some occurrence of $C$ as a substring.
The notion of covers was introduced by Apostolico and Ehrenfeucht over 30 years
ago [Theor. Comput. Sci. 1993] and it has received significant attention from
the combinatorial pattern matching community. In this note, we show how to
efficiently test whether $S$ admits a cover. Our tester can also be translated
into a streaming algorithm.
