This very preliminary text is related to ``Algorithms on Texts'', also called
``Algorithmic Stringology''. It is an extension of the book ``125 Problems in
Text Algorithms'' providing, in the same compact style, more problems with
solutions. We refer also to the companions to ``Text algorithms'' available at
http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf and at the web page
http://125-problems.univ-mlv.fr, where all 150 problems (including the ones
presented here) are briefly announced. The selected problems satisfy three
criteria: challenging, having short tricky solutions and solvable with only
very basic background in stringology. For the basics in stringology we refer to
http://monge.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/CLR/clr1-20.pdf.
