We introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical
concept of rooted minors in graphs. $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair
$(G, \chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly
empty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the
classical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing
the removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models
algorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated
vertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing
several theorems characterizing $\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where
$\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned
all colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face.
Leveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -
parameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit
the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the
algorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful
minor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with
the fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this
implies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits
a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic
meta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of
treewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known
AMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph
but also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.
