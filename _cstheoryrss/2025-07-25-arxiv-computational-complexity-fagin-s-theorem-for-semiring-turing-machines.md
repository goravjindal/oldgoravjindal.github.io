In recent years, quantitative complexity over semirings has been intensively
investigated. An important problem in this context is to connect computational
complexity with logical expressiveness. In this paper we improve on the model
of \emph{Semiring Turing Machines} (distinct from so called weighted Turing
machines) introduced by Eiter \& Kiesel (Semiring Reasoning Frameworks in AI
and Their Computational Complexity, \emph{J. Artif. Intell. Res.}, 2023). Our
central result is a Fagin-style theorem for a new quantitative complexity class
using a suitable weighted logical formalism. We show that the quantitative
complexity class that we call \NPnewinf{$\mathcal{R}$}, where $\mathcal{R}$ is
a commutative semiring, can be captured using a version of weighted existential
second-order logic that allows for predicates interpreted as semiring-annotated
relations. This result provides a precise logical characterization of the power
series that form the class \NPnewinf{$\mathcal{R}$}. We also give the exact
relation between Eiter \& Kiesel's version of NP, called
\NPoldinf{$\mathcal{R}$}, and the class \NPnewinf{$\mathcal{R}$}. Incidentally,
we are able to recapture all the complexity results by Eiter \& Kiesel (2023)
in our new model, connecting a quantitative version of NP to various counting
complexity classes.
