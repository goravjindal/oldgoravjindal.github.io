This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework for the computational
design, simulation, and fabrication of a hexagonal grid-based double-curvature
structure with planar hexagonal panels. The journey begins with constructing a
robust data structure through the meticulous subdivision of an equilateral
triangle surface, forming a foundational triangular grid. This grid is the
basis for a graph that encapsulates hexagons, laying the groundwork for
simulating dynamic interactions and form-finding. The developed algorithm
ensures a well-structured hexagonal grid data representation, and the
experimental results showcase the successful implementation of the algorithm,
leading to the fabrication of planar hexagons mirroring physics-generated mesh
surfaces.
