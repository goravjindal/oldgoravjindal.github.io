Let $k\ge 1$ be an integer. A positive integer $n$ is $k$-\textit{gleeful} if
$n$ can be represented as the sum of $k$th powers of consecutive primes. For
example, $35=2^3+3^3$ is a $3$-gleeful number, and $195=5^2+7^2+11^2$ is
$2$-gleeful. In this paper, we present some new results on $k$-gleeful numbers
for $k>1$.
First, we extend previous analytical work. For given values of $x$ and $k$,
we give explicit upper and lower bounds on the number of $k$-gleeful
representations of integers $n\le x$.
Second, we describe and analyze two new, efficient parallel algorithms, one
theoretical and one practical, to generate all $k$-gleeful representations up
to a bound $x$.
Third, we study integers that are multiply gleeful, that is, integers with
more than one representation as a sum of powers of consecutive primes,
including both the same or different values of $k$. We give a simple heuristic
model for estimating the density of multiply-gleeful numbers, we present
empirical data in support of our heuristics, and offer some new conjectures.
