While the existence of a stable matching for the stable roommates problem
possibly with incomplete preference lists (SRI) can be decided in polynomial
time, SRI problems with some fairness criteria are intractable. Egalitarian SRI
that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of agents if a stable matching
exists, is such a hard variant of SRI. For experimental evaluations of methods
to solve these hard variants of SRI, several well-known algorithms have been
used to randomly generate benchmark instances. However, these benchmark
instances are not always satisfiable, and usually have a small number of stable
matchings if one exists. For such SRI instances, despite the NP-hardness of
Egalitarian SRI, it is practical to find an egalitarian stable matching by
enumerating all stable matchings. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm
to generate benchmark instances for SRI that have very large numbers of
solutions, and for which it is hard to find an egalitarian stable matching by
enumerating all stable matchings.
