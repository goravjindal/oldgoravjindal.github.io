Submodular functions and their optimization have found applications in
diverse settings ranging from machine learning and data mining to game theory
and economics. In this work, we consider the constrained maximization of a
submodular function, for which we conduct a principled study of bicriteria
approximation algorithms -- algorithms which can violate the constraint, but
only up to a bounded factor. Bicrteria optimization allows constrained
submodular maximization to capture additional important settings, such as the
well-studied submodular cover problem and optimization under soft constraints.
We provide results that span both multiple types of constraints (cardinality,
knapsack, matroid and convex set) and multiple classes of submodular functions
(monotone, symmetric and general). For many of the cases considered, we provide
optimal results. In other cases, our results improve over the state-of-the-art,
sometimes even over the state-of-the-art for the special case of
single-criterion (standard) optimization. Results of the last kind demonstrate
that relaxing the feasibility constraint may give a perspective about the
problem that is useful even if one only desires feasible solutions.
