In analogy to flexible bipyramids, also known as Bricard octahedra, we study
flexible couplings of two Bennett mechanisms. The resulting flexible bi-Bennett
structures can be used as building blocks of flexible tubes with quadrilateral
cross-section that possess skew faces. We present three 4-dimensional families
of flexible arranged Bennett tubes and discuss some of their properties as well
as their relation to flexible bipyramids and biprisms, respectively.
