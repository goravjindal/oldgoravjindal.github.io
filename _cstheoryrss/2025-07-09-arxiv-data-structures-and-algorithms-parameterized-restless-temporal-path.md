Recently, Bumpus and Meeks introduced a purely temporal parameter, called
vertex-interval-membership-width, which is promising for the design of
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for vertex reachability problems in
temporal graphs. We study this newly introduced parameter for the problem of
restless temporal paths, in which the waiting time at each node is restricted.
In this article, we prove that, in the interval model, where arcs are present
for entire time intervals, finding a restless temporal path is NP-hard even if
the vertex-interval-membership-width is equal to three. We exhibit FPT
algorithms for the point model, where arcs are present at specific points in
time, both with uniform delay one and arbitrary positive delays. In the latter
case, this comes with a slight additional computational cost.
