Heegaard splittings provide a natural representation of closed 3-manifolds by
gluing handlebodies along a common surface. These splittings can be
equivalently given by two finite sets of meridians lying in the surface, which
define a Heegaard diagram. We present a data structure to effectively represent
Heegaard diagrams as normal curves with respect to triangulations of a surface
of complexity measured by the space required to express the normal coordinates'
vectors in binary. This structure can be significantly more compressed than
triangulations of 3-manifolds, given exponential gains for some families. Even
with this succinct definition of complexity, we establish polynomial time
algorithms for comparing and manipulating diagrams, performing stabilizations,
detecting trivial stabilizations and reductions, and computing topological
invariants of the underlying manifolds, such as their fundamental and first
homology groups. We also contrast early implementations of our techniques with
standard software programs for 3-manifolds, achieving better precision and
faster algorithms for the average cases and exponential gains in speed for some
particular presentations of the inputs.
