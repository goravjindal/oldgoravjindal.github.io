Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the
topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified
three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization.
Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with
the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic
to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to
generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of
these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative
of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb
graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the
geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing
Reeb graphs.
