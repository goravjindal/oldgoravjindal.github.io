The detection and classification of intersections between triangles are
crucial tasks in a wide range of applications within Computer Graphics and
Geometry Processing, including mesh Arrangements, mesh Booleans, and generic
mesh processing and fixing tasks. Existing methods are hard-coded and deeply
integrated into specific algorithms, and significant efforts are usually
required to integrate them into new pipelines or to extend them to different
numerical representations. This paper presents a versatile and exhaustive
algorithm to identify and classify intersections between triangles with either
floating points, rational numbers, or implicit representations. The proposed
tool is implemented as a C++ templated and header-only code that is generic and
easy to integrate into further algorithms requiring the triangle-triangle
intersection detection step. The developed tool has been tested and compared
with a state-of-the-art approach, and it is shared with the Geometry Processing
community with an Open Source license.
