By effectivizing a Kakeya set construction, we prove the existence of lines
in all directions that do not contain any double exponential time random
points. This means each point on these lines has an algorithmically predictable
location, to the extent that a gambler in an environment with fair payouts can,
using double exponential time computing resources, amass unbounded capital
placing bets on increasingly precise estimates of the point's location. Our
result resolves an open question published by Lutz and Lutz (2015).
