Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from
quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum
thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement.
Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest
possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit
dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth
that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally
bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies
of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the
state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum
pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms,
these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these
properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of
computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from
structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of
from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing
these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum
computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum
pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.
