We provide a linear time algorithm to determine the flip distance between two
plane spanning paths on a point set in convex position. At the same time, we
show that the happy edge property does not hold in this setting. This has to be
seen in contrast to several results for reconfiguration problems where the
absence of the happy edge property implies algorithmic hardness of the flip
distance problem. Further, we show that our algorithm can be adapted for (1)
compatible flips (2) local flips and (3) flips for plane spanning paths in
simple polygons.
