Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and
unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an
important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a
pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised
machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a
bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two
theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path
planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change
and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections,
fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are
more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed
kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum
phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's
toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their
superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow
kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived
and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key
concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and
machine learning of topological quantum order.
