The #2-SAT and #3-SAT problems involve counting the number of satisfying
assignments (also called models) for instances of 2-SAT and 3-SAT,
respectively. In 2010, Zhou et al. proposed an $\mathcal{O}^\*(1.1892^m)$-time
algorithm for #2-SAT and an efficient approach for #3-SAT, where $m$ denotes
the number of clauses. In this paper, we show that the weighted versions of
#2-SAT and #3-SAT can be solved in $\mathcal{O}^\*(1.1082^m)$ and
$\mathcal{O}^\*(1.4423^m)$ time, respectively. These results directly apply to
the unweighted cases and achieve substantial improvements over the previous
results. These advancements are enabled by the introduction of novel reduction
rules, a refined analysis of branching operations, and the application of path
decompositions on the primal and dual graphs of the formula.
