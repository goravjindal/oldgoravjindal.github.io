We consider the existence and construction of \textit{biclique covers} of
graphs, consisting of coverings of their edge sets by complete bipartite
graphs. The \textit{size} of such a cover is the sum of the sizes of the
bicliques. Small-size biclique covers of graphs are ubiquitous in computational
geometry, and have been shown to be useful compact representations of graphs.
We give a brief survey of classical and recent results on biclique covers and
their applications, and give new families of graphs having biclique covers of
near-linear size.
In particular, we show that semilinear graphs, whose edges are defined by
linear relations in bounded dimensional space, always have biclique covers of
size $O(n\polylog n)$. This generalizes many previously known results on
special classes of graphs including interval graphs, permutation graphs, and
graphs of bounded boxicity, but also new classes such as intersection graphs of
L-shapes in the plane. It also directly implies the bounds for Zarankiewicz's
problem derived by Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran (\textit{Forum
Math. Sigma}, 2021).
We also consider capped graphs, also known as terrain-like graphs, defined as
ordered graphs forbidding a certain ordered pattern on four vertices.
Terrain-like graphs contain the induced subgraphs of terrain visibility graphs.
We give an elementary proof that these graphs admit biclique partitions of size
$O(n\log^3 n)$. This provides a simple combinatorial analogue of a classical
result from Agarwal, Alon, Aronov, and Suri on polygon visibility graphs
(\textit{Discrete Comput. Geom.} 1994).
Finally, we prove that there exists families of unit disk graphs on $n$
vertices that do not admit biclique coverings of size $o(n^{4/3})$, showing
that we are unlikely to improve on Szemer\'edi-Trotter type incidence bounds
for higher-degree semialgebraic graphs.
