Human verification under adversarial information flow operates as a
cost-bounded decision procedure constrained by working memory limits and
cognitive biases. We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA)
coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work between
populations under identical claim distributions. Drawing on probabilistically
checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory, we construct
dissemination protocols that reduce verification for trusted audiences to
constant human effort while imposing superlinear costs on adversarial
populations lacking cryptographic infrastructure. We prove theoretical
guarantees for this asymmetry, validate the framework through controlled user
studies measuring verification effort with and without spot-checkable
provenance, and demonstrate practical encoding of real-world information
campaigns. The results establish complexity-theoretic foundations for
engineering democratic advantage in cognitive warfare, with immediate
applications to content authentication, platform governance, and information
operations doctrine.
