We present an algorithm for a class of $n$-fold ILPs: whose existing
algorithms in literature typically (1) are based on the \textit{augmentation
framework} where one starts with an arbitrary solution and then iteratively
moves towards an optimal solution by solving appropriate programs; and (2)
require solving a linear relaxation of the program. Combinatorial $n$-fold ILPs
is a class introduced and studied by Knop et al. [MP2020] that captures several
other problems in a variety of domains. We present a simple and direct
algorithm that solves Combinatorial $n$-fold ILPs with unbounded non-negative
variables via an application of the Steinitz lemma, a classic result regarding
reordering of vectors. Depending on the structure of the input, we also improve
upon the existing algorithms in literature in terms of the running time,
thereby showing an improvement that mirrors the one shown by Rohwedder
[ICALP2025] contemporaneously and independently.
