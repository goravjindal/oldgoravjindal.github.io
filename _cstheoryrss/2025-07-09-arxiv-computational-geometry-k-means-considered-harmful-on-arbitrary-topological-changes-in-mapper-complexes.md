The Mapper construction is one of the most widespread tools from Topological
Data Analysis. There is an unfortunate trend as the construction has gained
traction to use clustering methods with properties that end up distorting any
analysis results from the construction. In this paper we will see a few ways in
which widespread choices of clustering algorithms have arbitrarily large
distortions of the features visible in the final Mapper complex.
