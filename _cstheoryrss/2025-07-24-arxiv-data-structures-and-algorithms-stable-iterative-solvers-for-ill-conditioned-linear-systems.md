Iterative solvers for large-scale linear systems such as Krylov subspace
methods can diverge when the linear system is ill-conditioned, thus
significantly reducing the applicability of these iterative methods in practice
for high-performance computing solutions of such large-scale linear systems. To
address this fundamental problem, we propose general algorithmic frameworks to
modify Krylov subspace iterative solution methods which ensure that the
algorithms are stable and do not diverge. We then apply our general frameworks
to current implementations of the corresponding iterative methods in SciPy and
demonstrate the efficacy of our stable iterative approach with respect to
numerical experiments across a wide range of synthetic and real-world
ill-conditioned linear systems.
