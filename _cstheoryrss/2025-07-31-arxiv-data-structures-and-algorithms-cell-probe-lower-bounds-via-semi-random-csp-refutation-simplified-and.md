A recent work (Korten, Pitassi, and Impagliazzo, FOCS 2025) established an
insightful connection between static data structure lower bounds, range
avoidance of $\text{NC}^0$ circuits, and the refutation of pseudorandom CSP
instances, leading to improvements to some longstanding lower bounds in the
cell-probe/bit-probe models. Here, we improve these lower bounds in certain
cases via a more streamlined reduction to XOR refutation, coupled with handling
the odd-arity case. Our result can be viewed as a complete derandomization of
the state-of-the-art semi-random $k$-XOR refutation analysis (Guruswami,
Kothari and Manohar, STOC 2022, Hsieh, Kothari and Mohanty, SODA 2023), which
complements the derandomization of the even-arity case obtained by Korten et
al.
As our main technical statement, we show that for any multi-output
constant-depth circuit that substantially stretches its input, its output is
very likely far from strings sampled from distributions with sufficient
independence, and further this can be efficiently certified. Via suitable
shifts in perspectives, this gives applications to cell-probe lower bounds and
range avoidance algorithms for $\mathsf{NC}^0$ circuits.
