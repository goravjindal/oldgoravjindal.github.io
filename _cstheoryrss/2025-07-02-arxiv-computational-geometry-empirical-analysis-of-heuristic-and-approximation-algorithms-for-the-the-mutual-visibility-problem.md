The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical
analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper
addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms - a
direct greedy heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic
algorithm - on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with
analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results
demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set
sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved
solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the
absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless,
validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other
heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.
