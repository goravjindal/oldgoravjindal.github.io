A retailer is purchasing goods in bundles from suppliers and then selling
these goods in bundles to customers; her goal is to maximize profit, which is
the revenue obtained from selling goods minus the cost of purchasing those
goods. In this paper, we study this general trading problem from the retailer's
perspective, where both suppliers and customers arrive online. The retailer has
inventory constraints on the number of goods from each type that she can store,
and she must decide upon arrival of each supplier/customer which goods to
buy/sell in order to maximize profit.
We design an algorithm with logarithmic competitive ratio compared to an
optimal offline solution. We achieve this via an exponential-weight-update
dynamic pricing scheme, and our analysis dual fits the retailer's profit with
respect to a linear programming formulation upper bounding the optimal offline
profit. We prove (almost) matching lower bounds, and we also extend our result
to an incentive compatible mechanism. Prior to our work, algorithms for trading
bundles were known only for the special case of selling an initial inventory.
