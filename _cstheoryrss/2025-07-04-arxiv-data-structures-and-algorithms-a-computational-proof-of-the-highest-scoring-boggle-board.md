Finding all the words on a Boggle board is a classic computer programming
problem. With a fast Boggle solver, local optimization techniques such as
hillclimbing and simulated annealing can be used to find particularly
high-scoring boards. The sheer number of possible Boggle boards has
historically prevented an exhaustive search for the global optimum board. We
apply Branch and Bound and a decision diagram-like data structure to perform
the first such search. We find that the highest-scoring boards found via
hillclimbing are, in fact, the global optima.
