The most celebrated and extensively studied model of distributed computing is
the {\em message-passing model,} in which each vertex/node of the (distributed
network) graph corresponds to a static computational device that communicates
with other devices through passing messages. In this paper, we consider the
{\em agentic model} of distributed computing which extends the message-passing
model in a new direction. In the agentic model, computational devices are
modeled as relocatable or mobile computational devices (called agents in this
paper), i.e., each vertex/node of the graph serves as a container for the
devices, and hence communicating with another device requires relocating to the
same node. We study two fundamental graph level tasks, leader election, and
minimum spanning tree, in the agentic model, which will enhance our
understanding of distributed computation across paradigms. The objective is to
minimize both time and memory complexities. Following the literature, we
consider the synchronous setting in which each agent performs its operations
synchronously with others, and hence the time complexity can be measured in
rounds. In this paper, we present two deterministic algorithms for leader
election: one for the case of $k
