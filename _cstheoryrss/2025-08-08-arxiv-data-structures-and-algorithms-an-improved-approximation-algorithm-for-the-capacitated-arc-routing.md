The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), introduced by Golden and Wong in
1981, is an important arc routing problem in Operations Research, which
generalizes the famous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). When every
customer has a unit demand, the best known approximation ratio for CARP, given
by Jansen in 1993, remains $\frac{5}{2}-\frac{1.5}{k}$, where $k$ denotes the
vehicle capacity. Based on recent progress in approximating CVRP, we improve
this result by proposing a
$(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm, which to
the best of our knowledge constitutes the first improvement over Jansen's
bound.
