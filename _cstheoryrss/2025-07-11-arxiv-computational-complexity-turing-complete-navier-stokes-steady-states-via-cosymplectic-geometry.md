In this article, we construct stationary solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations on certain Riemannian $3$-manifolds that exhibit Turing completeness,
in the sense that they are capable of performing universal computation. This
universality arises on manifolds admitting nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms, thus
showing that computational universality is not obstructed by viscosity,
provided the underlying geometry satisfies a mild cohomological condition. The
proof makes use of a correspondence between nonvanishing harmonic $1$-forms and
cosymplectic geometry, which extends the classical correspondence between
Beltrami fields and Reeb flows on contact manifolds.
