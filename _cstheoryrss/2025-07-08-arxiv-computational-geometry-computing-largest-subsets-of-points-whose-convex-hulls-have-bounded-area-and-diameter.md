We study the problem of computing a convex region with bounded area and
diameter that contains the maximum number of points from a given point set $P$.
We show that this problem can be solved in $O(n^6k)$ time and $O(n^3k)$ space,
where $n$ is the size of $P$ and $k$ is the maximum number of points in the
found region. We experimentally compare this new algorithm with an existing
algorithm that does the same but without the diameter constraint, which runs in
$O(n^3k)$ time. For the new algorithm, we use different diameters. We use both
synthetic data and data from an application in cancer detection, which
motivated our research.
