We study the m-Eternal Domination problem, which is the following two-player
game between a defender and an attacker on a graph: initially, the defender
positions k guards on vertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns
between the defender and the attacker, with the attacker selecting a vertex and
the defender responding to the attack by moving a guard to the attacked vertex.
The defender may move more than one guard on their turn, but guards can only
move to neighboring vertices. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k
guards if the defender has a strategy such that at every point of the game the
vertices occupied by guards form a dominating set of G and the attacker wins
otherwise. The m-eternal domination number of a graph G is the smallest value
of k for which (G,k) is a defender win.
We show that m-Eternal Domination is NP-hard, as well as some of its
variants, even on special classes of graphs. We also show structural results
for the Domination and m-Eternal Domination problems in the context of four
types of infinite regular grids: square, octagonal, hexagonal, and triangular,
establishing tight bounds.
