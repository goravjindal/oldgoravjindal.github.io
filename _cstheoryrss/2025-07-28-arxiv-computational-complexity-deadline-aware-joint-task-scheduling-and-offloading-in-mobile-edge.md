The demand for stringent interactive quality-of-service has intensified in
both mobile edge computing (MEC) and cloud systems, driven by the imperative to
improve user experiences. As a result, the processing of computation-intensive
tasks in these systems necessitates adherence to specific deadlines or
achieving extremely low latency. To optimize task scheduling performance,
existing research has mainly focused on reducing the number of late jobs whose
deadlines are not met. However, the primary challenge with these methods lies
in the total search time and scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present
the optimal job scheduling algorithm designed to determine the optimal task
order for a given set of tasks. In addition, users are enabled to make informed
decisions for offloading tasks based on the information provided by servers.
The details of performance analysis are provided to show its optimality and low
complexity with the linearithmic time O(nlogn), where $n$ is the number of
tasks. To tackle the uncertainty of the randomly arriving tasks, we further
develop an online approach with fast outage detection that achieves rapid
acceptance times with time complexity of O(n). Extensive numerical results are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of
the service ratio and scheduling cost.
