The paper introduces final state identification (synchronizing and homing)
sequences for Timed Finite State Machines (TFSMs) with output delays and
investigates their properties. We formally define the notions of homing
sequences (HSs) and synchronizing sequences (SSs) for these TFSMs and
demonstrate that several properties that hold for untimed machines do not
necessarily apply to timed ones. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of
various approaches for deriving SSs and HSs for Timed FSMs with output delays,
such as truncated successor tree-based and FSM abstraction-based methods.
Correspondingly, we identify the subclasses of TFSMs for which these approaches
can be directly applied and those for which other methods are required.
Additionally, we evaluate the complexity of existence check and derivation of
(shortest) HSs / SSs for TFSMs with output delays.
