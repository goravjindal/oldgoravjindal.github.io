We study minimum cost constraint satisfaction problems (MinCostCSP) through
the algebraic lens. We show that for any constraint language $\Gamma$ which has
the dual discriminator operation as a polymorphism, there exists a
$|D|$-approximation algorithm for MinCostCSP$(\Gamma)$ where $D$ is the domain.
Complementing our algorithmic result, we show that any constraint language
$\Gamma$ where MinCostCSP$(\Gamma)$ admits a constant-factor approximation must
have a \emph{near-unanimity} (NU) polymorphism unless P = NP, extending a
similar result by Dalmau et al. on MinCSPs. These results imply a dichotomy of
constant-factor approximability for constraint languages that contain all
permutation relations (a natural generalization for Boolean CSPs that allow
variable negation): either MinCostCSP$(\Gamma)$ has an NU polymorphism and is
$|D|$-approximable, or it does not have any NU polymorphism and is NP-hard to
approximate within any constant factor. Finally, we present a constraint
language which has a majority polymorphism, but is nonetheless NP-hard to
approximate within any constant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture,
showing that the condition of having an NU polymorphism is in general not
sufficient unless UGC fails.
