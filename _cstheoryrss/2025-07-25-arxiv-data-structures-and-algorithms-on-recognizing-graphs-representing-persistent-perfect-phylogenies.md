The Persistent Perfect phylogeny, also known as Dollo-1, has been introduced
as a generalization of the well-known perfect phylogenetic model for binary
characters to deal with the potential loss of characters. The problem of
deciding the existence of a Persistent Perfect phylogeny can be reduced to the
one of recognizing a class of bipartite graphs whose nodes are species and
characters. Thus an interesting question is solving directly the problem of
recognizing such graphs. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding
Persistent Perfect phylogeny existence in maximal graphs, where no character's
species set is contained within another character's species set. Our solution,
that relies only on graph properties, narrows the gap between the linear-time
simple algorithm for Perfect Phylogeny and the NP-hardness results for the
Dollo-$k$ phylogeny with $k>1$.
