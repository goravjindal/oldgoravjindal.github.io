Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating
quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical
hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one
can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of
Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove
the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed
states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen
et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states
that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular
orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex
Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first
rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant
regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a
maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the
conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143
(2013)].
