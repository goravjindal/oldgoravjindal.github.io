We study two online resource-allocation problems with reusability in an
adversarial setting, namely kRental-Fixed and kRental-Variable. In both
problems, a decision-maker manages $k$ identical reusable units and faces a
sequence of rental requests over time. We develop theoretically grounded
relax-and-round algorithms with provable competitive-ratio guarantees for both
settings. For kRental-Fixed, we present an optimal randomized algorithm that
attains the best possible competitive ratio: it first computes an optimal
fractional allocation via a price-based approach, then applies a novel lossless
online rounding scheme to obtain an integral solution. For kRental-Variable, we
prove that lossless online rounding is impossible. We introduce a
limited-correlation rounding technique that treats each unit independently
while introducing controlled dependencies across allocation decisions involving
the same unit. Coupled with a carefully crafted price-based method for
computing the fractional allocation, this yields an order-optimal competitive
ratio for the variable-duration setting.
