August 11-13, 2025 Oxford, UK https://feasible-math.org/events/PC25/ Proof complexity is a vibrant area in the intersection of computational complexity, algorithms and mathematical logic exploring the inherent difficulty of proving statements in different formal proof systems. This workshop aims to cover both traditional topics and emerging trends in the field, including lower bounds on lengths of proofs, â€¦ [Continue reading Proof Complexity 2025](https://cstheory-events.org/2025/07/08/proof-complexity-2025/)
