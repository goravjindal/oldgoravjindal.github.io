A family of sets satisfies the $(p,2)$-property if among any $p$ sets in the
family, some two intersect. Two recent works used elaborate geometric
techniques to show that any family of non-piercing regions in the plane that
satisfies the $(p,2)$-property can be pierced by $O(p^9)$ points. In this note
we show that even in a much more general setting, piercing by $O(p)$ points can
be deduced from known results on hypergraphs with a hereditarily linear
Delaunay graph, which include intersection hypergraphs of non-piercing regions.
