Douglas Hofstadter first published [Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) in 1979 and my then high school self tried, and failed, to read though the entire book. It focused on the contradictions, with Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems, M. C. Escher's [Drawing Hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands) and Johann Sebastian Bach's [Canon a 2 per tonos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXXO2dN3P_w), a piece that keeps rising until it ends a whole tone higher than it started.

I'd prefer to focus less on the paradoxes and self-reference to the true beauty and complexity of computation. So now having had a long career in the field, who would I call on to capture the power and beauty of computing?

It has to start with Alan Turing. His seminal paper [On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem](https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230) gives a clean model for computation and still the best argument (Section 9) for why this simple model captures everything computable. The Entscheidungsproblem, that you can't mechanize all of mathematics, comes as a consequence, not as a goal of the paper. In a much later paper, [The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1952.0012), he shows how the beauty of nature can emerge naturally from computation, which of course we now know much better arises from discrete DNA sequences.

For music, instead of Bach's abstract works, I prefer to focus on the emotional power of music that still arises from a musical score that is [not unlike a computer program](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/11/music-theory-for-theorists.html) in the way it lays out the composition. Take for example Richard Wagner's [Prelude and Liebestod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZreeVzaOEo) (the beginning and the end of his opera Tristan and Isolde). It captures the tension of the two lovers from the very first notes and keeps that tension going until it resolves at the very end.

While soccer and basketball have mostly continuous play, I prefer that great American game of baseball that after each pitch has a very discrete state space that stadiums would capture with a few light bulbs (strikes, balls, outs), and yet could keep the excitement and tension on every one of those pitches. No one dominated the game more in his time than [George Herman "Babe" Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth), who I might have admittedly also chose to keep the same syllable cadence as Hofstadter.

So let's thank Turing, Wagner, Ruth, and the many others that showed we can show how incredible complexity and beauty can arise in the simplicity of computation. So many stories to tell.
