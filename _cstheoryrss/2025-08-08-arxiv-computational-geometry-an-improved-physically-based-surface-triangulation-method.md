This paper proposes improvements to the physically-based surface
triangulation method, bubble meshing. The method simulates physical bubbles to
automatically generate mesh vertices, resulting in high-quality Delaunay
triangles. Despite its flexibility in local mesh size control and the advantage
of local re-meshing, bubble meshing is constrained by high computational costs
and slow convergence on complex surfaces. The proposed approach employs
conformal mapping to simplify surface bubble packing by flattening the surface
onto a plane. Surface triangulation is induced from the planar mesh, avoiding
direct bubble movement on the surface. Optimizing bubble quantity control and
separating it from the relaxation process accelerates convergence, cutting
computation time by over 70%. The enhanced method enables efficient
triangulation of disk topology surfaces, supports local size control, curvature
adaptation, and re-meshing of discrete surfaces. Keywords: Adaptive
triangulation, Surface remeshing, Bubble meshing, Conformal parameterization,
Algorithm efficiency
