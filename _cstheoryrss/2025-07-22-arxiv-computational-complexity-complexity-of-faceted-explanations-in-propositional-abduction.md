Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain
observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as
diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In
propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional
formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has
been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for
Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems
(counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore,
we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand
explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets
to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation
(relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets
provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations
(heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two
explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We
comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings,
including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.
