Andr\'eka and Maddux classified the relation algebras with at most 3 atoms,
and in particular they showed that all of them are representable. Hirsch and
Cristiani showed that the network satisfaction problem (NSP) for each of these
algebras is in P or NP-hard. There are relation algebras with 4 atoms that are
not representable, and there are many results in the literature about
representations and non-representability of relation algebras with at most 4
atoms. We extend the result of Hirsch and Cristiani to relation algebras with
at most 4 atoms: the NSP is always either in P or NP-hard. To this end, we
construct universal, fully universal, or even normal representations for these
algebras, whenever possible.
