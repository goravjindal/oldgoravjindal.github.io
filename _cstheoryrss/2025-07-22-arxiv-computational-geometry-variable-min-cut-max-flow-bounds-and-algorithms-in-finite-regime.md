The maximum achievable capacity from source to destination in a network is
limited by the min-cut max-flow bound; this serves as a converse limit. In
practice, link capacities often fluctuate due to dynamic network conditions. In
this work, we introduce a novel analytical framework that leverages tools from
computational geometry to analyze throughput in heterogeneous networks with
variable link capacities in a finite regime. Within this model, we derive new
performance bounds and demonstrate that increasing the number of links can
reduce throughput variability by nearly $90\%$. We formally define a notion of
network stability and show that an unstable graph can have an exponential
number of different min-cut sets, up to $O(2^{|E|})$. To address this
complexity, we propose an algorithm that enforces stability with time
complexity $O(|E|^2 + |V|)$, and further suggest mitigating the
delay-throughput tradeoff using adaptive rateless random linear network coding
(AR-RLNC).
