We provide a deterministic algorithm that outputs an $O(n^{3/4} \log
n)$-approximation for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two input
sequences of length $n$ in near-linear time. This is the first deterministic
approximation algorithm for LCS that achieves a sub-linear approximation ratio
in near-linear time.
