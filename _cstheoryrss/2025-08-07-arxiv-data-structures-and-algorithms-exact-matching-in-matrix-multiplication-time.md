Initiated by Mulmuley, Vazirani, and Vazirani (1987), many algebraic
algorithms have been developed for matching and related problems. In this
paper, we review basic facts and discuss possible improvements with the aid of
fast computation of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. In particular,
we show that the so-called exact matching problem can be solved with high
probability in asymptotically the same time order as matrix multiplication. We
also discuss its extension to the linear matroid parity problem.
