The Colonel Blotto game, formulated by Emile Borel, involves players
allocating limited resources to multiple battlefields simultaneously, with the
winner being the one who allocates more resources to each battlefield.
Computation of the Nash equilibrium, including of two person, zero sum, mixed
strategy Colonel Blotto games have encountered issues of scalability and
complexity owing to their PPAD completeness. This paper proposes an algorithm
that computes the same value as the Nash equilibrium but cannot be
characterized by the Fixed point Theorems of Tarski, Kakutani and Brouwer. The
reduced complexity of the proposed algorithm is based on dispensing with the
need for computing both players Nash strategies in Colonel Blotto games. The
same algorithm can, therefore, be extended to all two person, zero sum games to
compute the value of the Nash equilibrium. The theoretical superiority of the
proposed algorithm over both LP solvers and another method that computes the
same value of the game as its Nash equilibrium by a random assignment of
probabilities to the active strategy set of the defending player, is also
proposed.
