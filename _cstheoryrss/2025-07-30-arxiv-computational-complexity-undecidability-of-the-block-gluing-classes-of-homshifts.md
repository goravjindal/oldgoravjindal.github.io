A homshift is a $d$-dimensional shift of finite type which arises as the
space of graph homomorphisms from the grid graph $\mathbb Z^d$ to a finite
connected undirected graph $G$. While shifts of finite type are known to be
mired by the swamp of undecidability, homshifts seem to be better behaved and
there was hope that all the properties of homshifts are decidable. In this
paper we build on the work by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha
(arxiv:2211.04075) to show that finer mixing properties are undecidable for
reasons completely different than the ones used to prove undecidability for
general multidimensional shifts of finite type. Inspired by the work of Gao,
Jackson, Krohne and Seward (arxiv:1803.03872) and elementary algebraic
topology, we interpret the square cover introduced by Gangloff, Hellouin de
Menibus and Oprocha topologically. Using this interpretation, we prove that it
is undecidable whether a homshift is $\Theta(n)$-block gluing or not, by
relating this problem to the one of finiteness for finitely presented groups.
