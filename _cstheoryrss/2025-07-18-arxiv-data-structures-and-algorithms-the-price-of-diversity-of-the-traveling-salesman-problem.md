This paper introduces the concept of the "Price of Diversity" (PoD) in
discrete optimization problems, quantifying the trade-off between solution
diversity and cost. For a minimization problem, the PoD is defined as the
worst-case ratio, over all instances, of the minimum achievable cost of a
diverse set of $k$ solutions to the cost of a single optimal solution for the
same instance. Here, the cost of a $k$-solution set is determined by the most
expensive solution within the set. Focusing on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) as a key example, we study the PoD in the setting where $k$ edge-disjoint
tours are required. We establish that, asymptotically, the PoD of finding two
edge-disjoint tours is $\frac{8}{5}$ in a special one-dimensional case and 2 in
a general metric space. We obtain these results from analyzing a related
fundamental problem: the Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem (SHP), for which we
establish similar results.
