AÂ [new dean](https://www.iit.edu/news/illinois-tech-names-nicole-l-beebe-new-college-computing-dean) has taken my place, and I have returned to the professoriate at Illinois Tech, ending thirteen years in administration, six as dean and seven as department chair at Georgia Tech. I won't rule out more administrative roles in the future, but only if the right role presents itself.

I'll teach intro theory in the fall, my first course since 2018, and take a sabbatical in the spring, mostly at Oxford. I plan to focus on writing, hoping to get out another book or books and other projects. It will be hard to go back to traditional computational complexity research, the field has changed considerably. I plan to spend some time understanding how AI changes the way we think about computation. Particularly why we see many of the benefits of P = NP while cryptography remains secure.

Also for the first time in 13 years I don't have a "boss". Technically I report to the department chair, who until a few days ago reported to me. But tenure protects my job, I choose my own research agenda, and teaching and service assignments are more of a negotiation than a top-down decision. Freedom!

For the blog, I have held back talking about the inner workings of universities while I had administrative roles. I'll now be more open in giving my thoughts, at least in general terms.

The next chapter begins...
