Ward and Szab\'o [WS94] have shown that a complete graph with $N^2$ nodes
whose edges are colored by $N$ colors and that has at least two colors contains
a bichromatic triangle. This fact leads us to a total search problem: Given an
edge-coloring on a complete graph with N2 nodes using at least two colors and
at most N colors, find a bichromatic triangle. Bourneuf, Folwarczn\'y,
Hub\'acek, Rosen, and Schwartzbach [Bou+23] have proven that such a total
search problem, called Ward-Szab\'o, is PWPP-hard and belongs to the class
TFNP, a class for total search problems in which the correctness of every
candidate solution is efficiently verifiable. However, it is open which TFNP
subclass contains Ward-Szab\'o. This paper will improve the complexity upper
bound of Ward-Szab\'o. We prove that Ward-Szab\'o is in belongs to the
complexity class PPP, a TFNP subclass of problems in which the pigeonhole
principle guarantees the existence of solutions.
