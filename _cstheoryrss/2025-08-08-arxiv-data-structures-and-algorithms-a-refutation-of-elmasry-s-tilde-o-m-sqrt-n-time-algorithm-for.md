In this note we examine the recent paper "Breaking the Bellman-Ford
Shortest-Path Bound" by Amr Elmasry, where he presents an algorithm for the
single-source shortest path problem and claims that its running time complexity
is $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the
number of edges. We show that his analysis is incorrect, by providing an
example of a weighted graph on which the running time of his algorithm is
$\Omega(mn)$.
