It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on
average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed
$d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random
cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is
tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the
form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield
randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for
finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is
connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a
problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the
language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the
number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.
