The Minimum Vertex Cover problem, a classical NP-complete problem, presents
significant challenges for exact solution on large graphs. Fixed-Parameter
Tractability (FPT) offers a powerful paradigm to address such problems by
exploiting a parameter of the input, typically related to the size of the
desired solution. This paper presents an implementation and empirical
evaluation of an FPT algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Cover problem
parameterized by the size of the vertex cover, $k$. The algorithm utilizes a
branching strategy based on selecting adjacent vertices and recursively solving
subproblems on a reduced graph. We describe the algorithmic approach,
implementation details in Python, and present experimental results comparing
its performance against the SageMath computational system. The results
demonstrate that the FPT implementation achieves significant performance
improvements for instances with large numbers of vertices ($n$) but relatively
small values of the parameter ($k$), aligning with theoretical FPT complexity
guarantees. We also discuss potential optimizations that could further improve
the algorithm's performance, particularly concerning the branching factor.
