We study a version of the metric facility location problem (or, equivalently,
variants of the committee selection problem) in which we must choose $k$
facilities in an arbitrary metric space to serve some set of clients $C$. We
consider four different objectives, where each client $i\in C$ attempts to
minimize either the sum or the maximum of its distance to the chosen
facilities, and where the overall objective either considers the sum or the
maximum of the individual client costs. Rather than optimizing a single
objective at a time, we study how compatible these objectives are with each
other, and show the existence of solutions which are simultaneously
close-to-optimum for any pair of the above objectives. Our results show that
when choosing a set of facilities or a representative committee, it is often
possible to form a solution which is good for several objectives at the same
time, instead of sacrificing one desideratum to achieve another.
