We demonstrate that the internal logical structure of a quantum circuit can
leave a distinct thermodynamic signature under progressive decoherence. By
comparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform
counterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical
resources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into
the environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor $L\_d$, which
quantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions. We validate
our framework through detailed analysis of two 4-branch quantum circuits,
demonstrating greater entropy production with $L\_d \approx 1.615$ for
conditional versus uniform architectures. An ancilla-based experimental
protocol using controlled-phase gates provides a concrete pathway for detecting
these thermodynamic signatures on current quantum platforms. Our results
establish logical depth as a physically measurable quantity with implications
for circuit design, compilation strategies, and verification protocols.
