For a directed graph $G$, let $\mathrm{mindeg}(G)$ be the minimum among
in-degrees and out-degrees of all vertices of $G$. It is easy to see that $G$
contains a directed cycle of length at least $\mathrm{mindeg}(G)+1$. In this
note, we show that, even if $G$ is $2$-connected, it is NP-hard to check if $G$
contains a cycle of length at least $\mathrm{mindeg}(G)+3$. This is in contrast
with recent algorithmic results of Fomin, Golovach, Sagunov, and Simonov [SODA
2022] for analogous questions in undirected graphs.
