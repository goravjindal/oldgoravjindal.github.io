Two graphs $G\_1,G\_2$ are distinguished by the Weisfeiler--Leman isomorphism
test if and only if there is a tree $T$ that has a different number of
homomorphisms to $G\_1$ and to $G\_2$. There are two known proofs of this fact --
a logical proof by Dvorak and a linear-algebraic proof by Dell, Grohe, and
Rattan. We give another simple proof, based on ordering WL-labels and
asymptotic arguments.
