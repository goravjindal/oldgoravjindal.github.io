We study the algorithmic robustness of general finite Markov chains in terms
of their stationary distributions to general, adversarial corruptions of the
transition matrix. We show that for Markov chains admitting a spectral gap,
variants of the \emph{PageRank} chain are robust in the sense that, given an
\emph{arbitrary} corruption of the edges emanating from an $\epsilon$-measure
of the nodes, the PageRank distribution of the corrupted chain will be
$\mathsf{poly}(\varepsilon)$ close in total variation to the original
distribution under mild conditions on the restart distribution. Our work thus
shows that PageRank serves as a simple regularizer against broad, realistic
corruptions with algorithmic guarantees that are dimension-free and scale
gracefully in terms of necessary and natural parameters.
