We consider the problems of characterizing and testing the stability of
cellular automata configurations that evolve on a two-dimensional torus
according to threshold rules with respect to the von-Neumann neighborhood.
While stable configurations for Threshold-1 (OR) and Threshold-5 (AND) are
trivial (and hence easily testable), the other threshold rules exhibit much
more diverse behaviors. We first characterize the structure of stable
configurations with respect to the Threshold-2 (similarly, Threshold-4) and
Threshold-3 (Majority) rules. We then design and analyze a testing algorithm
that distinguishes between configurations that are stable with respect to the
Threshold-2 rule, and those that are $\epsilon$-far from any stable
configuration, where the query complexity of the algorithm is independent of
the size of the configuration and depends quadratically on $1/\epsilon$.
