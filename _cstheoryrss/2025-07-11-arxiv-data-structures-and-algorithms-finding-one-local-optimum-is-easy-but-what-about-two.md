The class PLS (Polynomial Local Search) captures the complexity of finding a
solution that is locally optimal and has proven to be an important concept in
the theory of local search. It has been shown that local search versions of
various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set
and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability
typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in
contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in
polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the
complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that
computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural
unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum
Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases
for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.
