A distribution over instances of a sampling problem is said to exhibit
transport disorder chaos if perturbing the instance by a small amount of random
noise dramatically changes the stationary distribution (in Wasserstein
distance). Seeking to provide evidence that some sampling tasks are hard on
average, a recent line of work has demonstrated that disorder chaos is
sufficient to rule out "stable" sampling algorithms, such as gradient methods
and some diffusion processes.
We demonstrate that disorder chaos does not preclude polynomial-time sampling
by canonical algorithms in canonical models. We show that with high probability
over a random graph $\boldsymbol{G} \sim G(n,1/2)$: (1) the hardcore model (at
fugacity $\lambda = 1$) on $\boldsymbol{G}$ exhibits disorder chaos, and (2)
Glauber dynamics run for $O(n)$ time can approximately sample from the hardcore
model on $\boldsymbol{G}$ (in Wasserstein distance).
