In this monograph, we study complexity classes that are defined using $O(\log
n)$-space bounded non-deterministic Turing machines. We prove salient results
of Computational Complexity in this topic such as the
Immerman-Szelepcs$\rm\acute{e}$nyi Theorem, the Isolating Lemma, theorems of
Mahajan-Vinay on the determinant and many consequences of these very important
results. The manuscript is intended to be a comprehensive textbook on the topic
of The Complexity of Logarithmic Space Bounded Counting Classes.
