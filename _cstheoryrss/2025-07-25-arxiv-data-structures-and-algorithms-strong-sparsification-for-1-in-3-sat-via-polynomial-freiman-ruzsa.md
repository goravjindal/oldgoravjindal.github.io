We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong
sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be
merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for
1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a
sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}\_2^d$.
This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem}
(Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent
interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for
approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad,
Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).
