Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a
framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences
of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained
using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated
procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement
learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens.
This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as
Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces
algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely
classes.
