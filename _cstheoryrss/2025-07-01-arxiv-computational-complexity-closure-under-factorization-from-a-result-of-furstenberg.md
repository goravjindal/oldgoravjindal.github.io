We show that algebraic formulas and constant-depth circuits are closed under
taking factors. In other words, we show that if a multivariate polynomial over
a field of characteristic zero has a small constant-depth circuit or formula,
then all its factors can be computed by small constant-depth circuits or
formulas respectively.
Our result turns out to be an elementary consequence of a fundamental and
surprising result of Furstenberg from the 1960s, which gives a non-iterative
description of the power series roots of a bivariate polynomial. Combined with
standard structural ideas in algebraic complexity, we observe that this theorem
yields the desired closure results.
As applications, we get alternative (and perhaps simpler) proofs of various
known results and strengthen the quantitative bounds in some of them. This
includes a unified proof of known closure results for algebraic models
(circuits, branching programs and VNP), an extension of the analysis of the
Kabanets-Impagliazzo hitting set generator to formulas and constant-depth
circuits, and a (significantly) simpler proof of correctness as well as
stronger guarantees on the output in the subexponential time deterministic
algorithm for factorization of constant-depth circuits from a recent work of
Bhattacharjee, Kumar, Ramanathan, Saptharishi & Saraf.
