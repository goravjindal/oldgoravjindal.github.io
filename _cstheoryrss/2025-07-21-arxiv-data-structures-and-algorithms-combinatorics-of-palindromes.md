We investigate the structure and reconstruction complexity of Manacher
arrays. First, we establish a combinatorial lower bound, proving that the
number of rooted tandem repeat trees with $n+1$ genes exceeds the number of
distinct Manacher arrays of length $n$. Second, we introduce a graph-theoretic
framework that associates a graph to each Manacher array, where every proper
vertex coloring yields a string consistent with the array. Finally, we analyze
a reconstruction algorithm by I et al. (SPIRE 2010), showing that it
simultaneously achieves a globally minimal alphabet size, uses at most
$\log\_2(n{-}1) + 2$ distinct symbols, and can be adapted to produce
reconstructions over arbitrary alphabets when possible. Our results also
resolve an open problem posed by the original authors. Together, these findings
advance the combinatorial understanding of Manacher arrays and open new
directions for string reconstruction under structural constraints.
