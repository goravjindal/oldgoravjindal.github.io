We consider a natural extension of online makespan scheduling on identical
parallel machines by introducing scenarios. A scenario is a subset of jobs, and
the task of our problem is to find a global assignment of the jobs to machines
so that the maximum makespan under a scenario, i.e., the maximum makespan of
any schedule restricted to a scenario, is minimized.
For varying values of the number of scenarios and machines, we explore the
competitiveness of online algorithms. We prove tight and near-tight bounds,
several of which are achieved through novel constructions. In particular, we
leverage the interplay between the unit processing time case of our problem and
the hypergraph coloring problem both ways: We use hypergraph coloring
techniques to steer an adversarial family of instances proving lower bounds,
which in turn leads to lower bounds for several variants of online hypergraph
coloring.
