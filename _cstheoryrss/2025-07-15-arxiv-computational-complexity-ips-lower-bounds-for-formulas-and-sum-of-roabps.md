We give new lower bounds for the fragments of the Ideal Proof System (IPS)
introduced by Grochow and Pitassi (JACM 2018). The Ideal Proof System is a
central topic in algebraic proof complexity developed in the context of
Nullstellensatz refutation (Beame, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pitassi, Pudlak, FOCS
1994) and simulates Extended Frege efficiently. Our main results are as
follows.
1. mult-IPS\_{Lin'}: We prove nearly quadratic-size formula lower bound for
multilinear refutation (over the Boolean hypercube) of a variant of the
subset-sum axiom polynomial. Extending this, we obtain a nearly matching
qualitative statement for a constant degree target polynomial.
2. IPS\_{Lin'}: Over the fields of characteristic zero, we prove
exponential-size sum-of-ROABPs lower bound for the refutation of a variant of
the subset-sum axiom polynomial. The result also extends over the fields of
positive characteristics when the target polynomial is suitably modified. The
modification is inspired by the recent results (Hakoniemi, Limaye, Tzameret,
STOC 2024 and Behera, Limaye, Ramanathan, Srinivasan, ICALP 2025).
The mult-IPS\_{Lin'} lower bound result is obtained by combining the
quadratic-size formula lower bound technique of Kalorkoti (SICOMP 1985) with
some additional ideas. The proof technique of IPS\_{Lin'} lower bound result is
inspired by the recent lower bound result of Chatterjee, Kush, Saraf and
Shpilka (CCC 2024).
