Chromatic metric pairs consist of a metric space and a coloring function
partitioning a subset thereof into various colors. It is a natural extension of
the notion of chromatic point sets studied in chromatic topological data
analysis. A useful tool in the field is the six-pack, a collection of six
persistence diagrams, summarizing homological information about how the colored
subsets interact. We introduce a suitable generalization of the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance to compare chromatic metric pairs. We show some basic
properties and validate this definition by obtaining the stability of the
six-pack with respect to that distance. We conclude by discussing its
restriction to metric pairs and its role in the stability of the \v{C}ech
persistence diagrams.
