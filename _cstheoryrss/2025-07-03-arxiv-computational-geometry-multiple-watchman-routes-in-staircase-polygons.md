We consider the watchman route problem for multiple watchmen in staircase
polygons, which are rectilinear $x$- and $y$-monotone polygons. For two
watchmen, we propose an algorithm to find an optimal solution that takes
quadratic time, improving on the cubic time of a trivial solution. For $m \geq
3$ watchmen, we explain where this approach fails, and present an approximation
algorithm for the min-max criterion with only an additive error.
