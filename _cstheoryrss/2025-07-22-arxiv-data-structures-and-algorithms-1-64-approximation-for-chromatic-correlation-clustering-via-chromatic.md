Chromatic Correlation Clustering (CCC) generalizes Correlation Clustering by
assigning multiple categorical relationships (colors) to edges and imposing
chromatic constraints on the clusters. Unlike traditional Correlation
Clustering, which only deals with binary $(+/-)$ relationships, CCC captures
richer relational structures. Despite its importance, improving the
approximation for CCC has been difficult due to the limitations of standard LP
relaxations. We present a randomized $1.64$-approximation algorithm to the CCC
problem, significantly improving the previous factor of $2.15$. Our approach
extends the cluster LP framework to the chromatic setting by introducing a
chromatic cluster LP relaxation and an rounding algorithm that utilizes both a
cluster-based and a greedy pivot-based strategy. The analysis bypasses the
integrality gap of $2$ for the CCC version of standard LP and highlights the
potential of the cluster LP framework to address other variants of clustering
problems.
