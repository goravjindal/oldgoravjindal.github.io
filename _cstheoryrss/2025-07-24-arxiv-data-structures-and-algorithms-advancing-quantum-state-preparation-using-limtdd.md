Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computing
and quantum information processing. It is critical to the execution of many
quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper,
we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers
of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single
ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our algorithms
are based on a novel decision diagram that is fundamentally different from the
approaches used in previous QSP algorithms. Specifically, our approach exploits
the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly
compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and
decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and
exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of
runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential
improvement in best-case scenarios. This paper is an extended version of [1],
with three more algorithms proposed.
