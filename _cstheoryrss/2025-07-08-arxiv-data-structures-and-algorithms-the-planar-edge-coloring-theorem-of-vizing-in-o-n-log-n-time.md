In 1965, Vizing [Diskret. Analiz, 1965] showed that every planar graph of
maximum degree $\Delta\ge 8$ can be edge-colored using $\Delta$ colors. The
direct implementation of the Vizing's proof gives an algorithm that finds the
coloring in $O(n^2)$ time for an $n$-vertex input graph. Chrobak and Nishizeki
[J. Algorithms, 1990] have shown a more careful algorithm, which improves the
time to $O(n\log n)$ time, though only for $\Delta\ge 9$. In this paper, we
extend their ideas to get an algorithm also for the missing case $\Delta=8$. To
this end, we modify the original recoloring procedure of Vizing. This
generalizes to bounded genus graphs.
