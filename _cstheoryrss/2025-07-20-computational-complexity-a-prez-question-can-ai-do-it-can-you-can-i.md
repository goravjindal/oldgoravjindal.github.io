title: "Computational Complexity: A Prez Question: Can AI do it? Can you? Can I?"

 I am curious how AI or humans can do on the following question.  
  
I have listed out the nominees for Prez and VP (Vice Prez) since 1976 and put them in two categories.  
  
What criteria did I use?  
  
The criteria is about their lives. So it's not going to be something like  
  
The ones in GROUP ONE have last names with at most 3 vowels.  
  
A few notes before the lists:  
  
1) You may come up with  criteria I didn't come up with.  It may even be outside of my rules- for example about vowels. Fine- I will be curious if some criteria like that happen to be equivalent to my criteria.  
  
2) You can use whatever you want- Wikipedia, ChatGPT, your friend who knows a lot about presidents.  
  
3) Leave comments with your proposed answer AND HOW YOU GOT IT, though be warned to NOT go to the comments if you want to work on it yourself, since the right answer might be there.  
  
4) There are people who were the nominees for Prez or VP several times.  
I want the list to be in chronological order. I list everyone only once.  
What to do about (say) the fact  
that Bob Dole ran for VP in 1976 and for Prez in 1996?  
I list people in order of the FIRST time they were the nominee.  
So I have:  
  
VP 1976. Prez-1996  
Bob Dole

5) I added some misc information for fun. That information is NOT relevant to the solution.
