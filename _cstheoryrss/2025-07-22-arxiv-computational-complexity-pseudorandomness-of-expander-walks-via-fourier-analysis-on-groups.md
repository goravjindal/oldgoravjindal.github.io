One approach to study the pseudorandomness properties of walks on expander
graphs is to label the vertices of an expander with elements from an alphabet
$\Sigma$, and study the mean of functions over $\Sigma^n$. We say expander
walks $\varepsilon$-fool a function if, for any unbiased labeling of the
vertices, the expander walk mean is $\varepsilon$-close to the true mean. We
show that:
- The class of symmetric functions is $O(|\Sigma|\cdot\lambda)$-fooled by
expander walks over any generic $\lambda$-expander, and any alphabet $\Sigma$ .
This generalizes the result of Cohen, Peri, Ta-Shma [STOC'21] which analyzes it
for $|\Sigma| =2$, and exponentially improves the previous bound of
$O(|\Sigma|^{O(|\Sigma|)}\cdot \lambda)$, by Golowich and Vadhan [CCC'22].
Additionally, if the expander is a Cayley graph over $\mathbb{Z}\_{|\Sigma|}$,
we get a further improved bound of $O(\sqrt{|\Sigma|}\cdot\lambda)$.
Morever, when $\Sigma$ is a finite group $G$, we show the following for
functions over $G^n$:
- The class of symmetric class functions is
$O\Big({\frac{\sqrt{|G|}}{D}\cdot\lambda}\Big)$-fooled by expander walks over
"structured" $\lambda$-expanders, if $G$ is $D$-quasirandom.
- We show a lower bound of $\Omega(\lambda)$ for symmetric functions for any
finite group $G$ (even for "structured" $\lambda$-expanders).
- We study the Fourier spectrum of a class of non-symmetric functions arising
from word maps, and show that they are exponentially fooled by expander walks.
Our proof employs Fourier analysis over general groups, which contrasts with
earlier works that have studied either the case of $\mathbb{Z}\_2$ or
$\mathbb{Z}$. This enables us to get quantitatively better bounds even for
unstructured sets.
