We provide the first non-trivial lower bounds for single-qubit tomography
algorithms and show that at least ${\Omega}\left(\frac{10^N}{\sqrt{N}
\varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies are required to learn an $N$-qubit state
$\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d},d=2^N$ to within $\varepsilon$ trace distance.
Pauli measurements, the most commonly used single-qubit measurement scheme,
have recently been shown to require at most
$O\left(\frac{10^N}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies for this problem. Combining
these results, we nearly settle the long-standing question of the complexity of
single-qubit tomography.
