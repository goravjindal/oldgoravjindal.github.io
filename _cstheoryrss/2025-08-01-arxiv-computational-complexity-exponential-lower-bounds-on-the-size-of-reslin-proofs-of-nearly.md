Itsykson and Sokolov identified resolution over parities, denoted by
$\text{Res}(\oplus)$, as a natural and simple fragment of
$\text{AC}^0[2]$-Frege for which no super-polynomial lower bounds on size of
proofs are known. Building on a recent line of work, Efremenko and Itsykson
proved lower bounds of the form $\text{exp}(N^{\Omega(1)})$, on the size of
$\text{Res}(\oplus)$ proofs whose depth is upper bounded by $O(N\log N)$, where
$N$ is the number of variables of the unsatisfiable CNF formula. The hard
formula they used was Tseitin on an appropriately expanding graph, lifted by a
$2$-stifling gadget. They posed the natural problem of proving super-polynomial
lower bounds on the size of proofs that are $\Omega(N^{1+\epsilon})$ deep, for
any constant $\epsilon > 0$.
We provide a significant improvement by proving a lower bound on size of the
form $\text{exp}(\tilde{\Omega}(N^{\epsilon}))$, as long as the depth of the
$\text{Res}(\oplus)$ proofs are $O(N^{2-\epsilon})$, for every $\epsilon > 0$.
Our hard formula is again Tseitin on an expander graph, albeit lifted with a
different type of gadget. Our gadget needs to have small correlation with all
parities.
An important ingredient in our work is to show that arbitrary distributions
\emph{lifted} with such gadgets fool \emph{safe} affine spaces, an idea which
originates in the earlier work of Bhattacharya, Chattopadhyay and Dvorak.
