Given an integer $k\geq1$ and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\REAL^d$, the
classic $k$-PCA (Principle Component Analysis) approximates the affine
\emph{$k$-subspace mean} of $P$, which is the $k$-dimensional affine linear
subspace that minimizes its sum of squared Euclidean distances
($\ell\_{2,2}$-norm) over the points of $P$, i.e., the mean of these distances.
The \emph{$k$-subspace median} is the subspace that minimizes its sum of
(non-squared) Euclidean distances ($\ell\_{2,1}$-mixed norm), i.e., their
median. The median subspace is usually more sparse and robust to noise/outliers
than the mean, but also much harder to approximate since, unlike the
$\ell\_{z,z}$ (non-mixed) norms, it is non-convex for $k
