      "content": "Authors: Ben Bals, Sebastiaan van Krieken, Solon P. Pissis, Leen Stougie, Hilde Verbeek\n\nThe reduction of the fragment assembly problem to (variations of) the\nclassical Eulerian trail problem [Pevzner et al., PNAS 2001] has led to\nremarkable progress in genome assembly. This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\nThe pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\nWe focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the\nproblem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \\cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$\nand $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks\n[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,\nhighlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give\ncombinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an\nalgorithm parametrized by $w (\\log w+1) /(k-1)$. Our improved algorithm shows\nthat it is enough when the range of positions is small relative to $k$.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Rares-Darius Buhai, Yiding Hua, David Steurer, Andor Vári-Kakas\n\nWe establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for\ncoloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related\nclasses of graphs. For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided\nexpander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative\nsize at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$\nfraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$\nwith the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This\nresult improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)\ndeveloping an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative\nsize at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient\n$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong\nregular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\\epsilon)$-factor\napproximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\\epsilon&gt;0$.\nWe propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$\nmatrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove\nthat whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem\nis NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the\nother hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the\ncorresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.\nAs starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph\nspectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The\nnumber of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\\tau$ is at most $O(1/\\tau^{2})$\ntimes the number of eigenvalues larger than $\\tau^{2}/2$. While this result\nallows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided\nspectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic\nresults.\n\nRead original post\n"

In this paper, we extend this result by constructing a formula with the same hardness properties, but which additionally admits a resolution refutation of quasi-polynomial size. This establishes a supercritical tradeoff between size and depth for resolution over parities.\nThe proof builds on the framework of Alekseev and Itsykson and relies on a lifting argument applied to the supercritical tradeoff between width and depth in resolution, proposed by Buss and Thapen (IPL 2026).\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "\n\nScott Aaronson’s Brief Foreword:\n\nHarvey Lederman is a distinguished analytic philosopher who moved from Princeton to UT Austin a few years ago. Since his arrival, he’s become one of my best friends among the UT professoriate. He’s my favorite kind of philosopher, the kind who sees scientists as partners in discovering the truth, and also has a great sense of humor. He and I are both involved in UT’s new AI and Human Objectives Initiative (AHOI), which is supported by Open Philanthropy.\n\nThe other day, Harvey emailed me an eloquent meditation he wrote on what will be the meaning of life if AI doesn’t kill us all, but “merely” does everything we do better than we do it. While the question is of course now extremely familiar to me, Harvey’s erudition—bringing to bear everything from speculative fiction to the history of polar exploration—somehow brought the stakes home for me in a new way.\n\nHarvey mentioned that he’d sent his essay to major magazines but hadn’t had success. So I said, why not a Shtetl-Optimized guest post? Harvey replied—what might be the highest praise this blog has ever received—well, that would be even better than the national magazine, as it would reach more relevant people.\n\nAnd so without further ado, I present to you…\n\n\n\nChatGPT and the Meaning of Life, by Harvey Lederman\n\nFor the last two and a half years, since the release of ChatGPT, I’ve been suffering from fits of dread. It’s not every minute, or even every day, but maybe once a week, I’m hit by it—slackjawed, staring into the middle distance—frozen by the prospect that someday, maybe pretty soon, everyone will lose their job.\n\nAt first, I thought these slackjawed fits were just a phase, a passing thing. I’m a philosophy professor; staring into the middle distance isn’t exactly an unknown disease among my kind. But as the years have begun to pass, and the fits have not, I’ve begun to wonder if there’s something deeper to my dread. Does the coming automation of work foretell, as my fits seem to say, an irreparable loss of value in human life?\n\nThe titans of artificial intelligence tell us that there’s nothing to fear. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, the maker of Claude, suggests that: “historical hunter-gatherer societies might have imagined that life is meaningless without hunting,” and “that our well-fed technological society is devoid of purpose.” But of course, we don’t see our lives that way. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, sounds so similar, the text could have been written by ChatGPT. Even if the jobs of the future will look as “fake” to us as ours do to “a subsistence farmer”, Altman has “no doubt they will feel incredibly important and satisfying to the people doing them.”\n\nAlongside these optimists, there are plenty of pessimists who, like me, are filled with dread. Pope Leo XIV has decried the threats AI poses to “human dignity, labor and justice”. Bill Gates has written about his fear, that “if we solved big problems like hunger and disease, and the world kept getting more peaceful: What purpose would humans have then?” And Douglas Hofstadter, the computer scientist and author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, has spoken eloquently of his terror and depression at “an oncoming tsunami that is going to catch all of humanity off guard.”\n\nWho should we believe? The optimists with their bright visions of a world without work, or the pessimists who fear the end of a key source of meaning in human life?\n\n\n\nI was brought up, maybe like you, to value hard work and achievement. In our house, scientists were heroes, and discoveries grand prizes of life. I was a diligent, obedient kid, and eagerly imbibed what I was taught. I came to feel that one way a person’s life could go well was to make a discovery, to figure something out.\n\nI had the sense already then that geographical discovery was played out. I loved the heroes of the great Polar Age, but I saw them—especially Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott—as the last of their kind. In December 1911, Amundsen reached the South Pole using skis and dogsleds. Scott reached it a month later, in January 1912, after ditching the motorized sleds he’d hoped would help, and man-hauling the rest of the way. As the black dot of Amundsen’s flag came into view on the ice, Scott was devastated to reach this “awful place”, “without the reward of priority”. He would never make it back.\n\nScott’s motors failed him, but they spelled the end of the great Polar Age. Even Amundsen took to motors on his return: in 1924, he made a failed attempt for the North Pole in a plane, and, in 1926, he successfully flew over it, in a dirigible. Already by then, the skis and dogsleds of the decade before were outdated heroics of a bygone world.\n\nWe may be living now in a similar twilight age for human exploration in the realm of ideas. Akshay Venkatesh, whose discoveries earned him the 2018 Fields Medal, mathematics’ highest honor, has written that, the “mechanization of our cognitive processes will alter our understanding of what mathematics is”. Terry Tao, a 2006 Fields Medalist, expects that in just two years AI will be a copilot for working mathematicians. He envisions a future where thousands of theorems are proven all at once by mechanized minds.\n\nNow, I don’t know any more than the next person where our current technology is headed, or how fast. The core of my dread isn’t based on the idea that human redundancy will come in two years rather than twenty, or, for that matter, two hundred. It’s a more abstract dread, if that’s a thing, dread about what it would mean for human values, or anyway my values, if automation “succeeds”: if all mathematics—and, indeed all work—is done by motor, not by human hands and brains.\n\nA world like that wouldn’t good news for my childhood dreams. Venkatesh and Tao, like Amundsen and Scott, live meaningful lives, lives of purpose. But worthwhile discoveries like theirs are a scarce resource. A territory, once seen, can’t be seen first again. If mechanized minds consume all the empty space on the intellectual map, lives dedicated to discovery won’t be lives that humans can lead.\n\nThe right kind of pessimist sees here an important argument for dread. If discovery is valuable in its own right, the loss of discovery could be an irreparable loss for humankind.\n\nA part of me would like this to be true. But over these last strange years, I’ve come to think it’s not. What matters, I now think, isn’t being the first to figure something out, but the consequences of the discovery: the joy the discoverer gets, the understanding itself, or the real life problem their knowledge solves. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, and through that work saved thousands, perhaps millions of lives. But if it were to emerge, in the annals of an outlandish future, that an alien discovered penicillin thousands of years before Fleming did, we wouldn’t think that Fleming’s life was worse, just because he wasn’t first. He eliminated great suffering from human life; the alien discoverer, if they’re out there, did not. So, I’ve come to see, it’s not discoveries themselves that matter. It’s what they bring about.\n\n\n\nBut the advance of automation would mean the end of much more than human discovery. It could mean the end of all necessary work. Already in 1920, the Czech playwright Karel Capek asked what a world like that would mean for the values in human life. In the first act of R.U.R.—the play which introduced the modern use of the word “robot”—Capek has Henry Domin, the manager of Rossum’s Universal Robots (the R.U.R. of the title), offer his corporation’s utopian pitch. “In ten years”, he says, their robots will “produce so much corn, so much cloth, so much everything” that “There will be no poverty.” “Everybody will be free from worry and liberated from the degradation of labor.” The company’s engineer, Alquist, isn’t convinced. Alquist (who, incidentally, ten years later, will be the only human living, when the robots have killed the rest) retorts that “There was something good in service and something great in humility”, “some kind of virtue in toil and weariness”.\n\nService—work that meets others’ significant needs and wants— is, unlike discovery, clearly good in and of itself. However we work— as nurses, doctors, teachers, therapists, ministers, lawyers, bankers, or, really, anything at all—working to meet others’ needs makes our own lives go well. But, as Capek saw, all such work could disappear. In a “post-instrumental” world, where people are comparatively useless and the bots meet all our important needs, there would be no needed work for us to do, no suffering to eliminate, no diseases to cure. Could the end of such work be a better reason for dread?\n\nThe hardline pessimists say that it is. They say that the end all needed work would not only be a loss of some value to humanity, as everyone should agree. For them it would be a loss to humanity on balance, an overall loss, that couldn’t be compensated in another way.\n\nI feel a lot of pull to this pessimistic thought. But once again, I’ve come to think it’s wrong. For one thing, pessimists often overlook just how bad most work actually is. In May 2021, Luo Huazhang, a 31 year-old ex-factory worker in Sichuan wrote a viral post, entitled “Lying Flat is Justice”. Luo had searched at length for a job that, unlike his factory job, would allow him time for himself, but he couldn’t find one. So he quit, biked to Tibet and back, and commenced his lifestyle of lying flat, doing what he pleased, reading philosophy, contemplating the world. The idea struck a chord with overworked young Chinese, who, it emerged, did not find “something great” in their “humility”. The movement inspired memes, selfies flat on one’s back, and even an anthem.\n\nThat same year, as the Great Resignation in the United States took off, the subreddit r/antiwork played to similar discontent. Started in 2013, under the motto “Unemployment for all, not only the rich!”, the forum went viral in 2021, starting with a screenshot of a quitting worker’s texts to his supervisor (“No thanks. Have a good life”), and culminating in labor-actions, first supporting striking workers at Kelloggs by spamming their job application site, and then attempting to support a similar strike at McDonald’s. It wasn’t just young Chinese who hated their jobs.\n\nIn Automation and Utopia: Human Flourishing in a World without Work, the Irish lawyer and philosopher John Danaher imagines an antiwork techno-utopia, with plenty of room for lying flat. As Danaher puts it: “Work is bad for most people most of the time.”“We should do what we can to hasten the obsolescence of humans in the arena of work.”\n\nThe young Karl Marx would have seen both Domin’s and Danaher’s utopias as a catastrophe for human life. In his notebooks from 1844, Marx describes an ornate and almost epic process, where, by meeting the needs of others through production, we come to recognize the other in ourselves, and through that recognition, come at last to self-consciousness, the full actualization of our human nature. The end of needed work, for the Marx of these notes, would be the impossibility of fully realizing our nature, the end, in a way, of humanity itself.\n\nBut such pessimistic lamentations have come to seem to me no more than misplaced machismo. Sure, Marx’s and my culture, the ethos of our post-industrial professional class, might make us regret a world without work. But we shouldn’t confuse the way two philosophers were brought up with the fundamental values of human life. What stranger narcissism could there be than bemoaning the end of others’ suffering, disease, and need, just because it deprives you of the chance to be a hero?\n\n\n\nThe first summer after the release of ChatGPT—the first summer of my fits of dread—I stayed with my in-laws in Val Camonica, a valley in the Italian alps. The houses in their village, Sellero, are empty and getting emptier; the people on the streets are old and getting older. The kids that are left—my wife’s elementary school class had, even then, a full complement of four—often leave for better lives. But my in-laws are connected to this place, to the houses and streets where they grew up. They see the changes too, of course. On the mountains above, the Adamello, Italy’s largest glacier, is retreating faster every year. But while the shows on Netflix change, the same mushrooms appear in the summer, and the same chestnuts are collected in the fall.\n\nWalking in the mountains of Val Camonica that summer, I tried to find parallels for my sense of impending loss. I thought about William Shanks, a British mathematician who calculated π to 707 digits by hand in 1873 (he made a mistake at 527; almost 200 digits were wrong). He later spent years of his life, literally years, on a table of the reciprocals of the primes up to one-hundred and ten thousand, calculating in the morning by hand, and checking it over in the afternoon. That was his life’s work. Just sixty years after his death, though, already in the 1940s, the table on which his precious mornings were spent, the few mornings he had on this earth, could be made by a machine in a day.\n\nI feel sad thinking about Shanks, but I don’t feel grief for the loss of calculation by hand. The invention of the typewriter, and the death of handwritten notes seemed closer to the loss I imagined we might feel. Handwriting was once a part of your style, a part of who you were. With its decline some artistry, a deep and personal form of expression, may be lost. When the bots help with everything we write, couldn’t we too lose our style and voice?\n\nBut more than anything I thought of what I saw around me: the slow death of the dialects of Val Camonica and the culture they express. Chestnuts were at one time so important for nutrition here, that in the village of Paspardo, a street lined with chestnut trees is called “bread street” (“Via del Pane”). The hyper-local dialects of the valley, outgrowths sometimes of a single family’s inside jokes, have words for all the phases of the chestnut. There’s a porridge made from chestnut flour that, in Sellero goes by ‘skelt’, but is ‘pult’ in Paspardo, a cousin of ‘migole’ in Malonno, just a few villages away. Boiled, chestnuts are tetighe; dried on a grat, biline or bascocc, which, seasoned and boiled become broalade. The dialects don’t just record what people eat and ate; they recall how they lived, what they saw, and where they went. Behind Sellero, every hundred-yard stretch of the walk up to the cabins where the cows were taken to graze in summer, has its own name. Aiva Codaola. Quarsanac. Coran. Spi. Ruc.\n\nBut the young people don’t speak the dialect anymore. They go up to the cabins by car, too fast to name the places along the way. They can’t remember a time when the cows were taken up to graze. Some even buy chestnuts in the store.\n\nGrief, you don’t need me to tell you, is a complicated beast. You can grieve for something even when you know that, on balance, it’s good that it’s gone. The death of these dialects, of the stories told on summer nights in the mountains with the cows, is a loss reasonably grieved. But you don’t hear the kids wishing more people would be forced to stay or speak this funny-sounding tongue. You don’t even hear the old folks wishing they could go back fifty years—in those days it wasn’t so easy to be sure of a meal. For many, it’s better this way, not the best it could be, but still better, even as they grieve what they stand to lose and what they’ve already lost.\n\nThe grief I feel, imagining a world without needed work, seems closest to this kind of loss. A future without work could be much better than ours, overall. But, living in that world, or watching as our old ways passed away, we might still reasonably grieve the loss of the work that once was part of who we were.\n\n\n\nIn the last chapter of Edith Wharton’s Age of Innocence, Newland Archer contemplates a world that has changed dramatically since, thirty years earlier, before these new fangled telephones and five-day trans-Atlantic ships, he renounced the love of his life. Awaiting a meeting that his free-minded son Dallas has organized with Ellen Olenska, the woman Newland once loved, he wonders whether his son, and this whole new age, can really love the way he did and does. How could their hearts beat like his, when they’re always so sure of getting what they want?\n\nThere have always been things to grieve about getting old. But modern technology has given us new ways of coming to be out of date. A generation born in 1910 did their laundry in Sellero’s public fountains. They watched their grandkids grow up with washing machines at home. As kids, my in-laws worked with their families to dry the hay by hand. They now know, abstractly, that it can all be done by machine. Alongside newfound health and ease, these changes brought, as well, a mix of bitterness and grief: grief for the loss of gossip at the fountains or picnics while bringing in the hay; and also bitterness, because the kids these days just have no idea how easy they have it now.\n\nAs I look forward to the glories that, if the world doesn’t end, my grandkids might enjoy, I too feel prospective bitterness and prospective grief. There’s grief, in advance, for what we now have that they’ll have lost: the formal manners of my grandparents they’ll never know, the cars they’ll never learn to drive, and the glaciers that will be long gone before they’re born. But I also feel bitter about what we’ve been through that they won’t have to endure: small things like folding the laundry, standing in security lines or taking out the trash, but big ones too—the diseases which will take our loved ones that they’ll know how to cure.\n\nAll this is a normal part of getting old in the modern world. But the changes we see could be much faster and grander in scale. Amodei of Anthropic speculates that a century of technological change could be compressed into the next decade, or less. Perhaps it’s just hype, but—what if it’s not? It’s one thing for a person to adjust, over a full life, to the washing machine, the dishwasher, the air-conditioner, one by one. It’s another, in five years, to experience the progress of a century. Will I see a day when childbirth is a thing of the past? What about sleep? Will our ‘descendants’ have bodies at all?\n\nAnd this round of automation could also lead to unemployment unlike any our grandparents saw. Worse, those of us working now might be especially vulnerable to this loss. Our culture, or anyway mine—professional America of the early 21st century—has apotheosized work, turning it into a central part of who we are. Where others have a sense of place—their particular mountains and trees—we’ve come to locate ourselves with professional attainment, with particular degrees and jobs. For us, ‘workists’ that so many of us have become, technological displacement wouldn’t just be the loss of our jobs. It would be the loss of a central way we have of making sense of our lives.\n\nNone of this will be a problem for the new generation, for our kids. They’ll know how to live in a world that could be—if things go well—far better overall. But I don’t know if I’d be able to adapt. Intellectual argument, however strong, is weak against the habits of years. I fear they’d look at me, stuck in my old ways, with the same uncomprehending look that Dallas Archer gives his dad, when Newland announces that he won’t go see Ellen Olenska, the love of his life, after all. “Say”, as Newland tries to explain to his dumbfounded son, “that I’m old fashioned, that’s enough.”\n\n\n\nAnd yet, the core of my dread is not about aging out of work before my time. I feel closest to Douglas Hofstadter, the author of *Gödel, Escher, Bach*. His dread, like mine, isn’t only about the loss of work today, or the possibility that we’ll be killed off by the bots. He fears that even a gentle superintelligence will be “as incomprehensible to us as we are to cockroaches.”\n\nToday, I feel part of our grand human projects—the advancement of knowledge, the creation of art, the effort to make the world a better place. I’m not in any way a star player on the team. My own work is off in a little backwater of human thought. And I can’t understand all the details of the big moves by the real stars. But even so, I understand enough of our collective work to feel, in some small way, part of our joint effort. All that will change. If I were to be transported to the brilliant future of the bots, I wouldn’t understand them or their work enough to feel part of the grand projects of their day. Their work would have become, to me, as alien as ours is to a roach.\n\n\n\nBut I’m still persuaded that the hardline pessimists are wrong. Work is far from the most important value in our lives. A post-instrumental world could be full of much more important goods— from rich love of family and friends, to new undreamt of works of art—which would more than compensate the loss of value from the loss of our work.\n\nOf course, even the values that do persist may be transformed in almost unrecognizable ways. In Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World, the futurist and philosopher Nick Bostrom imagines how things might look. In one of the most memorable sections of the book—right up there with an epistolary novella about the exploits of Pignolius the pig (no joke!)—Bostrom says that even child-rearing may be something that we, if we love our children, would come to forego. In a truly post-instrumental world, a robot intelligence could do better for your child, not only in teaching the child to read, but also in showing unbreakable patience and care. If you’ll snap at your kid, when the robot would not, it would only be selfishness for you to get in the way.\n\nIt’s a hard question whether Bostrom is right. At least some of the work of care isn’t like eliminating suffering or ending mortal disease. The needs or wants are small-scale stuff, and the value we get from helping each other might well outweigh the fact that we’d do it worse than a robot could.\n\nBut even supposing Bostrom is right about his version of things, and we wouldn’t express our love by changing diapers, we could still love each other. And together with our loved ones and friends, we’d have great wonders to enjoy. Wharton has Newland Archer wonder at five-day transatlantic ships. But what about five day journeys to Mars? These days, it’s a big deal if you see the view from Everest with your own eyes. But Olympus Mons on Mars is more than twice as tall.\n\nAnd it’s not just geographical tourism that could have a far expanded range. There’d be new journeys of the spirit as well. No humans would be among the great writers or sculptors of the day, but the fabulous works of art a superintelligence could make could help to fill our lives. Really, for almost any aesthetic value you now enjoy—sentimental or austere, minute or magnificent, meaningful or jocular—the bots would do it much better than we have ever done.\n\nHumans could still have meaningful projects, too. In 1976, about a decade before any of Altman, Amodei or even I were born, the Canadian philosopher Bernhard Suits argued that “voluntary attempts to overcome unnecessary obstacles” could give people a sense of purpose in a post-instrumental world. Suits calls these “games”, but the name is misleading; I prefer “artificial projects”. The projects include things we would call games like chess, checkers and bridge, but also things we wouldn’t think of as games at all, like Amundsen’s and Scott’s exploits to the Pole. Whatever we call them, Suits—who’s followed here explicitly by Danaher, the antiwork utopian and, implicitly, by Altman and Amodei—is surely right: even as things are now, we get a lot of value from projects we choose, whether or not they meet a need. We learn to play a piece on the piano, train to run a marathon, or even fly to Antartica to “ski the last degree” to the Pole. Why couldn’t projects like these become the backbone of purpose in our lives?\n\nAnd we could have one real purpose, beyond the artificial ones, as well. There is at least one job that no machine can take away: the work of self-fashioning, the task of becoming and being ourselves. There’s an aesthetic accomplishment in creating your character, an artistry of choice and chance in making yourself who you are. This personal style includes not just wardrobe or tattoos, not just your choice of silverware or car, but your whole way of being, your brand of patience, modesty, humor, rage, hobbies and tastes. Creating this work of art could give some of us something more to live for.\n\n\n\nWould a world like that leave any space for human intellectual achievement, the stuff of my childhood dreams? The Buddhist Pali Canon says that “All conditioned things are impermanent—when one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering.” Apparently, in this text, the intellectual achievement of understanding gives us a path out of suffering. To arrive at this goal, you don’t have to be the first to plant your flag on what you’ve understood; you just have to get there.\n\nA secular version of this idea might hold, more simply, that some knowledge or understanding is good in itself. Maybe understanding the mechanics of penicillin matters mainly because of what it enabled Fleming and others to do. But understanding truths about the nature of our existence, or even mathematics, could be different. That sort of understanding plausibly is good in its own right, even if someone or something has gotten there first.\n\nVenkatesh the Fields Medalist seems to suggest something like this for the future of math. Perhaps we’ll change our understanding of the discipline, so that it’s not about getting the answers, but instead about human understanding, the artistry of it perhaps, or the miracle of the special kind of certainty that proof provides.\n\nPhilosophy, my subject, might seem an even more promising place for this idea. For some, philosophy is a “way of life”. The aim isn’t necessarily an answer, but constant self-examination for its own sake. If that’s the point, then in the new world of lying flat, there could be a lot of philosophy to do.\n\nI don’t myself accept this way of seeing things. For me, philosophy aims at the truth as much as physics does. But I of course agree that there are some truths that it’s good for us to understand, whether or not we get there first. And there could be other parts of philosophy that survive for us, as well. We need to weigh the arguments for ourselves, and make up our own minds, even if the work of finding new arguments comes to belong to a machine.\n\nI’m willing to believe, and even hope that future people will pursue knowledge and understanding in this way. But I don’t find, here, much consolation for my personal grief. I was trained to produce knowledge, not merely to acquire it. In the hours when I’m not teaching or preparing to teach, my job is to discover the truth. The values I imbibed—and I told you I was an obedient kid—held that the prize goes for priority.\n\nThinking of this world where all we learn is what the bots have discovered first, I feel sympathy with Lee Sedol, the champion Go player who retired after his defeat by Google’s AlphaZero in 2016. For him, losing to AI “in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing”. “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.” Right or wrong, I would feel the same about my work, in a world with an automated philosophical champ.\n\nBut Sedol and I are likely just out of date models, with values that a future culture will rightly revise. It’s been more than twenty years since Garry Kasparov lost to IBM’s Deep Blue, but chess has never been more popular. And this doesn’t seem some new-fangled twist of the internet age. I know of no human who quit the high-jump after the invention of mechanical flight. The Greeks sprinted in their Olympics, though they had, long before, domesticated the horse. Maybe we too will come to value the sport of understanding with our own brains.\n\n\n\nFrankenstein, Mary Shelley’s 1818 classic of the creations-kill-creator genre, begins with an expedition to the North Pole. Robert Walton hopes to put himself in the annals of science and claim the Pole for England, when he comes upon Victor Frankenstein, floating in the Arctic Sea. It’s only once Frankenstein warms up, that we get into the story everyone knows. Victor hopes he can persuade Walton to turn around, by describing how his own quest for knowledge and glory went south.\n\nFrankenstein doesn’t offer Walton an alternative way of life, a guide for living without grand goals. And I doubt Walton would have been any more personally consoled by the glories of a post-instrumental future than I am. I ended up a philosopher, but I was raised by parents who, maybe like yours, hoped for doctors or lawyers. They saw our purpose in answering real needs, in, as they’d say, contributing to society. Lives devoted to families and friends, fantastic art and games could fill a wondrous future, a world far better than it has ever been. But those aren’t lives that Walton or I, or our parents for that matter, would know how to be proud of. It’s just not the way we were brought up.\n\nFor the moment, of course, we’re not exactly short on things to do. The world is full of grisly suffering, sickness, starvation, violence, and need. Frankenstein is often remembered with the moral that thirst for knowledge brings ruination, that scientific curiosity killed the cat. But Victor Frankenstein makes a lot of mistakes other than making his monster. His revulsion at his creation persistently prevents him, almost inexplicably, from feeling the love or just plain empathy that any father should. On top of all we have to do to help each other, we have a lot of work to do, in engineering as much as empathy, if we hope to avoid Frankenstein’s fate.\n\nBut even with these tasks before us, my fits of dread are here to stay. I know that the post-instrumental world could be a much better place. But its coming means the death of my culture, the end of my way of life. My fear and grief about this loss won’t disappear because of some choice consolatory words. But I know how to relish the twilight too. I feel lucky to live in a time where people have something to do, and the exploits around me seem more poignant, and more beautiful, in the dusk. We may be some of the last to enjoy this brief spell, before all exploration, all discovery, is done by fully automated sleds.\n\nBy Scott\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Mikkel Thorup, Hanzhi Wang, Zhewei Wei, Mingji Yang\n\nWe study the computational complexity of locally estimating a node’s PageRank\ncentrality in a directed graph $G$. For any node $t$, its PageRank centrality\n$\\pi(t)$ is defined as the probability that a random walk in $G$, starting from\na uniformly chosen node, terminates at $t$, where each step terminates with a\nconstant probability $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$.\nTo obtain a multiplicative $\\big(1\\pm O(1)\\big)$-approximation of $\\pi(t)$\nwith probability $\\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is\n$O(n^{1/2}\\min{ \\Delta_{in}^{1/2},\\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}})$ from [Wang,\nWei, Wen, Yang STOC ‘24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and\nedges in $G$, and $\\Delta_{in}$ and $\\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees\nand out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the\npreviously best lower bound of\n$\\Omega(n^{1/2}\\min{\\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\\gamma},\\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\\gamma},m^{1/4}})$,\nwhere $\\gamma=\\frac{\\log(1/(1-\\alpha))}{4\\log\\Delta_{in}-2\\log(1/(1-\\alpha))}$\nif $\\Delta_{in}&gt;1/(1-\\alpha)$, and $\\gamma=1/2$ if\n$\\Delta_{in}\\le1/(1-\\alpha)$. As $\\gamma$ only depends on $\\Delta_{in}$, the\nknown upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$,\nand $\\Delta_{out}$.

      "content": "Authors: Laxman Dhulipala, Monika Henzinger, George Z. Li, Quanquan C. Liu, A. R. Sricharan, Leqi Zhu\n\nMany differentially private and classical non-private graph algorithms rely\ncrucially on determining whether some property of each vertex meets a\nthreshold. For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic\npeeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls\nbelow a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to\ntransform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small\nadditive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph\nsetting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to\ncomposition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this\nproblem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we\ncall the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT\n(applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As\nan application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better\nbounds than previous work.\nWe apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety\nof problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree\nordering, and vertex coloring. We give a tight local edge DP algorithm for\n$k$-core decomposition with $O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log n)$ additive error and no\nmultiplicative error in $O(n)$ rounds. We also give a new $(2+\\eta)$-factor\nmultiplicative, $O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log n)$ additive error algorithm in $O(\\log^2\nn)$ rounds for any constant $\\eta &gt; 0$. Both of these results are\nasymptotically tight against our new lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ for any\nconstant-factor approximation algorithm for $k$-core decomposition. Our new\nalgorithms for $k$-core also directly lead to new algorithms for densest\nsubgraph and low out-degree ordering.

We present the mathematical and statistical\nfoundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization\nframework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to\nforce-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by\nits goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles\nin a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through\nsequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to\ncompute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local\noptima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a\nLaplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly\nhandles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input\ndissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding\nnon-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use\nof standard analytical tools.

We believe that, at the very least, the paper should be withdrawn, and Springer should conduct an investigation to understand how such a paper could have made it through the peer review process.\n\n\nBy Lance Fortnow\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "\n\nI’ve mentioned it obliquely many times on the blog, and I’m excited to finally be able to announce that my book, The Irrational Decision, is available for pre-order from Princeton University Press. (Preorder your copy here! Princeton, Bookshop, Amazon)\n\nAs the title suggests, this book is about rationality. But it’s about a very particular kind of instrumental, mathematical rationality that seems to dominate our contemporary discourse, where everything is a risk analysis or a bet. It’s the mathematical rationality that is popular with people who spend too much time around computers, be they the hyper-online rationalists, public intellectuals like Nate Silver or Steven Pinker, or our oligarchical billionaires. It’s the rationality where everything is about maximizing ends by whatever means necessary. The word rational can mean a lot of things. Why did this rigid definition become so dominant among the tech set?\n\nIt’s because the tech set invented this form of rationality when they were first building computers in the wake of World War II. The Irrational Decision traces how we came to believe that decisions in the face of uncertainty could be made through cold, mathematical calculation. As the title suggests, I think that conclusion is irrational, and the book explains how this formulation of mathematical rationality, while useful in many contexts, has always been known to be fundamentally limited, applicable only in particular sweet spots. The irrationality is the persistence that we can outsource everything to computers, despite decades of persistent evidence that this can’t work.\n\nIf we want to make “rational” decisions by math, we have to transform the world we experience into a mathematical model. We have to equate everything unknown with a mathematical language, which is usually the language of probability. We need to put all goals on the same playing field by associating them with a universal currency (we could call it utilitycoin). Once you write the equations about randomness and profits, a rational agent assesses the probability of various futures and chooses its action to maximize its returns. Hence, the mathematical version of rationality reduces all decision-making to a statistical analysis of risk. According to the contemporary rationalists—if we take them at their word—the only truly rational agent is the actuary. A completely robotic, computational insurance agent. An actuarial android. A paranoid android.\n\nLife is not a matter of pricing annuities. Why would we call it rational to treat it this way?\n\nThis question emerged after I started this project. Initially, I just wanted to understand why we kept reinventing the wheel in machine learning. Why was it that after 50 years of innovation, we circled back to a somewhat fancy version of Rosenblatt’s Perceptron in the 2010s? Was the perceptron also just a rehash of something from the 1890s? To my surprise, the answer was no.\n\nThe following technologies were all invented in the window between World War II and the IBM 701:\n\n\n  language models\n  information theory\n  linear programming\n  signal estimation theory\n  detection theory\n  game theory\n  stochastic gradient descent\n  neural networks\n  the randomized clinical trial\n\n\nI could go on, of course. We built computers to solve these problems and to systematize decision making. In building them, the designers of the modern computer baked in a particular mindset of what an ideal decision looked like. This ideal became a mirror in which we could see the imperfection of people. We decided people should make decisions like computers.\n\nThe problem is, this decision was irrational. We can only optimize simple problems. Parlor games don’t describe how people behave. Most of these tabulatory, numerical tools are natural fits for regulatory bureaucracy, but not for running your life. Mathematical rationality helps frame simple, small world decisions (see this excellent and excellently timed post by Max Raginsky). The vast majority of decisions can’t be outsourced to computers.\n\nWhile many people have written arguments to that effect before, The Irrational Decision explores the thinking of the mathematicians and engineers who built the fundamental algorithmic backbone. I wrote this book as a participant observer in the subject area, having spent a career steeped in the practice of machine learning, optimization, and statistics. I leveraged my connections there, speaking with as many colleagues as I could to gather contemporary perspectives on the historical lineage. I explore the intellectual history of automated decision making, engaging with the technical work of the intellectuals who took us down this path.\n\nThe Irrational Decision willbe out in early 2026. On the one hand, the slowness of book publishing drives me crazy. I’m very impatient, which is why I blog. But blogs are just first drafts of thoughts, and I know I put blog posts out faster than anyone else wants to read them. Blogging remains my process of writing practice and thought drafting. Lots of the ideas in the bookwere workshopped on here. That you all read it is a gift to me that I deeply appreciate.\n\nBooks are immutable final drafts. The permanence is a mixed blessing, as I change my mind all the time. But I do think The Irrational Decision compiles a specific web of stories that deserves a physical binding.1 It is a snapshot of the history of this technology and how it interfaces with our contemporary practices. It’s about how the same core ideas have been simmering for 80 years, continuously circled back to as we build progressively more powerful computing machines.\n\nI tried to make this history of the mathematical scaffolding of the computer age accessible to as many people as possible. I wrote the book for people who work in computer science or related computational fields (I suppose we call this “data science” now?). I’ve used the text in my machine learning classes, and I think parts could be assigned to undergrads. Contextualizing why we do what we do is helpful to make sense of our current computing craze.\n\nThe core intellectual idea of the latest AI bubble is taking the initial ideas from the 1940s and riding them to their logical conclusion. Either our tech overlords are right and they’ll build a superintelligence that enslaves humanity, or, even after covering the planet in data centers, there is still work to be done. I’m hoping this book points at ways to think about what we do if that second scenario plays out.\n\nI will further explore such alternatives in future projects, many of which you’ve seen seeds of on this blog. How we can conceptualize individual risk in non-probabilistic language. How we can stop the moral outsourcing of our choices to machines. How we can’t mechanism-design our way to utopia. The Irrational Decision is chapter one. Stick around here as we draft chapter two.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nI suppose I could have just thrown the book up on arxiv, but I’m excited to see where this more traditional publishing path takes me.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Finally, a post on the first! This month we have four papers, on understanding Nash Equilibria, deeper meditations on distribution testing, sublinear average degree estimation, and a paper on degree distributions that I’m quite excited to see.\n\nProtocols for Verifying Smooth Strategies in Bandits and Games by Miranda Christ, Daniel Reichman, and Jonathan Shafer (arXiv). Consider a (k)-player game where each player has (n) options. Given a (mixed) strategy for each player, we would like to know if this is an approximate Nash equilibrium. But think of (n) as extremely large, so algorithms need to be sublinear in (n). This is a natural requirement, since in many real-world games, the independent options come from an extremely large space. This paper studies this setting from the verification perspective. Assume the algorithm/verifier can communicate with an all powerful prover, and has access to the game matrix/tensor. We want to verifier to make sublinear queries to the game and have sublinear communication (in bits) with the prover. The main result shows that, under some “smoothness” condition on the near equilibrium strategies, one can actually get such sublinear verifiers for Nash equilibria. The starting results in the paper are for the simpler multi-armed bandit setting, which are generalized to more complex games.\n\nFaster Estimation of the Average Degree of a Graph Using Random Edges and Structural Queries by Lorenzo Beretta, Deeparnab Chakrabarty, and C. Seshadhri (arXiv). The problem of estimating the average degree of a graph in sublinear time is an old and classic problem. In a seminal work, Goldreich-Ron gave ((1+\\varepsilon))-approximations with (\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})) queries, where (n) is the number of vertices. (Up to (\\log n, \\varepsilon) factors, the bound is optimal.) This works in the classic model where an algorithm can sample uar vertices, query degrees, and get neighbors. Suppose uar edges are also available. In that case, Motwani-Panigrahy-Xu give an algorithm that makes (\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})) queries. What if one can also query pairs to check if they are edges? This is a standard operation in sublinear graph algorithms. Interestingly, this paper gives an (\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})) query algorithm for this setting. And, if one can get the entire adjacency list in a single query (common in the study of web networks), then there is an (\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/5})) query algorithm for this setting. This paper, following Beretta-Tetek, also studies the case where the number of vertices (n) is unknown, in which case the previous complexities change. Overall, there is a nuanced picture of the complexity of estimating the average degree.\n\nTowards Tight Bounds for Estimating Degree Distribution in Streaming and Query Models by Arijit Bishnu, Debarshi Chanda, Gopinath Mishra (arXiv). In network science, which is study of real-world large graphs, probably one of the most important graph parameters studied is the degree distribution. Formally, let (N(d)) be the number of vertices of degree (d). The set ({N(d)}) is sometimes called the “degree distribution”, though to be precise, it is the “complementary cumulative degree histogram” (ccdh). There is a rich applied history of estimating the ccdh, but the only truly sublinear bound was given by Eden-Jain-Pinar-Ron-Seshadhri. The actual complexity was a little involved, and your truly had posed (in WOLA 2019) the question of determining the optimal bound. Which, I’m happy to say, this paper has nailed down. Ignoring log factors, the complexity is (\\Theta(m/h)), where (m) is the number of edges and (h) is the, well, (h)-index of the degree distribution (the largest number (k) such that there are at least (k) vertices of degree at least (k)). The algorithm, which is similar to the previous result, is eminently practical and uses a combination of vertex and edge sampling to estimate different part of the distribution. Moreover, the algorithm can be implemented in the streaming setting.\n\nLocation-Invariant Properties of Functions versus Properties of Distributions: United in Testing but Separated in Verification by Oded Goldreich and Guy Rothblum (ECCC). Let us build up the distribution testing context. Consider a distribution (\\mathcal{D}) over universe ([n]). In the standard distribution testing setup, the tester gets samples from this distribution and has to (approximately) decide some property. One could imagine that there is an underlying space/function that actually generates this distribution. So think of (f:[m] \\to [n]), where (\\mathcal{D}(i)) is the fraction of the domain values (j) where (f(j) = i). A distribution property can be translated to the property/set of functions that induce the desired distributions. In the latter setting, there is more power, since a tester can explicitly query (j \\in [m]) to get (f(j)). (While, in the distribution setting, the tester merely gets (f(j)) for a uar (j \\in [m]).) It turns out that property testing in both settings are basically equivalent. This paper shows, to the contrary, there is a gap between these settings for the verification problem. Consider “doubly sublinear interactive protocols”, so that verifer must run with queries sublinear to the vanilla testing complexity, and the honest prover must run in queries sublinear to the learning complexity. For the classic uniformity testing problem, there is no such interactive protocol in the distribution testing setting. But, interestingly, there is a “doubly sublinear interactive protocol” in the functional setting, where the tester can get (o(\\sqrt{n})) to verify uniformity.\n\nBy Seshadhri\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Randomness is a fundamental requirement in cryptographic systems, enabling secure encryption, commitments, and zero-knowledge proofs. However, real-world randomness sources often suffer from weaknesses that adversaries can exploit, leading to significant security vulnerabilities. While deterministic randomness extraction from a single min-entropy source is impossible, two-source extractors provide a robust solution by generating nearly uniform randomness from two independent weak sources. Moreover, cryptographic systems must also be resilient to leakage and tampering attacks, necessitating the development of non-malleable two-source extractors.\nIn this work, we construct a two-source non-malleable extractor in the Common Reference String (CRS) model, where a random low-degree polynomial is sampled once and made accessible to independent random sources, the distinguisher, and the tamperer. Our extractor requires only linear min-entropy in both sources and doesn’t rely on strong computational assumptions, in contrast to prior constructions requiring computational assumptions such as sub-exponential hardness of the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem. Notably, our construction builds upon and relies on the recent breakthrough proof of the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture. A connection of the Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture with two-source extractors was considered in prior work [ZBS11],[AGMR24], but their construction did not achieve non-malleability.\nOur results advance the state of non-malleable cryptographic primitives, with applications in secure storage, leakage-resilient cryptography, and privacy amplification. By eliminating the need for strong computational hardness assumptions, our techniques provide a more foundational and widely applicable method for randomness extraction.\nWe also show, that the requirements on CRS for our application are so mild that the CRS can be sampled with 2 party computation even when one of the parties is malicious (setting in which establishing unbiased coins is impossible).\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Sorry for the long blog-hiatus! I was completely occupied for weeks, teaching an intensive course on theoretical computer science to 11-year-olds (!), at a math camp in St. Louis that was also attended by my 8-year-old son. Soon I’ll accompany my 12-year-old daughter to a science camp in Connecticut, where I’ll also give lectures.\n\nThere’s a great deal to say about these experiences, but for now: it’s been utterly transformative and life-affirming to spend my days in teaching precocious, enthusiastic, non-jaded children the material I love in the real world, rather than (let’s say) in scrolling through depressing world news and social media posts and emails from hateful trolls on my phone. It’s made me feel 25 years younger (well, at least until I need to walk up a flight of stairs). It’s made me want to go back to actual research and teaching, which besides family and friends have been the main sources of joy in my life.\n\n\n\nSo on that note, and without further ado: I hereby present the latest Quantum Complexity Theory Student Project Showcase! As the name suggests, this is where I share a selection of the best research projects, from the students who took my graduate class on Quantum Complexity Theory at UT Austin this past spring.\n\nSee here for the four previous iterations of the Showcase:\n\n\n  2011 edition (MIT)\n  2012 edition (MIT)\n  2014 edition (MIT)\n  2021 edition (MIT / UT Austin)\n\n\n(As you can see, the timing hasn’t been 100% consistent.)\n\nI expect that, as in past editions, many of this year’s projects will lead to published research papers, or at the very least, preprints on the arXiv.\n\n\n\nAnd now, really without further ado, the projects!\n\n(1) Quantum Hermite Transform and Gaussian Goldreich-Levin, by Vishnu Iyer and Siddhartha Jain.\n\nVishnu and Sid propose a new primitive for quantum algorithms—the Hermite transform, as opposed to the Fourier transform—and give at least one successful example of its use. They’d be eager to know if anyone can think of other applications!\n\n(2) Quantum Statistical Witness Indistinguishability, by Shafik Nassar and Ronak Ramachandran.\n\nIn modern cryptography, even if it isn’t statistical zero-knowledge (SZK), a proof protocol might have the weaker property of being statistically witness-indistinguishable (SWI): that is, Arthur can’t tell which of two possible yes-witnesses Merlin holds. Here Shafik and Ronak initiate the study of quantum SWI, and prove the basic properties of this notion, such as the equivalence of honest and dishonest verifier. Hopefully this will serve as a springboard for someone to find an actual QSWI protocol for an interesting problem.\n\n(3) A Zero-Knowledge Protocol for Keyed Unitary Families, by David Joy and Angela Zhang.\n\nContinuing the theme of quantum zero-knowledge, David and Angela give a protocol by which Merlin can convince Arthur that he knows a unitary relating one pure state to another, without revealing the unitary. Again continuing a theme, applications of this protocol are sought!\n\n(4) On Query Lower Bounds for Aaronson-Kuperberg Unitary Synthesis Circuits, by Arko Banerjee.\n\nBack in 2006, when we formulated our so-called “Unitary Synthesis Conjecture,” Greg Kuperberg and I showed that if a quantum algorithm applies an n-qubit unitary U(f) after making a single query to a Boolean function f, then as we range over f’s, there can be at most 4n possible values of U(f). Here Arko improves our bound to 2n, which is tight. He also tries extremely hard to generalize our bound to the two-query case, not quite succeeding but proving partial results that hopefully will be helpful to others.\n\n(5) Quantum Search with Non-Interacting Bosons and Fermions, by Aravind Karthigeyan.\n\nThis one really made me think. Aravind studies the problem of search for a single marked vertex, on the complete graph with N vertices, using either M bosons or M fermions that can hop between the vertices. With M bosons, he shows that the search succeeds in Θ(√(N/M)) time with high probability, which is just the usual runtime for Grover search with M parallel searchers. With fermions, by contrast, he shows that more time is needed. Why? Because of the Pauli Exclusion Principle! The fermions all “step on each others’ toes,” competing to be the one that jumps onto the marked vertex, which limits the advantage of having M fermions searching in parallel.\n\n(6) Limits to Pseudodeterminism in Quantum Communication Protocols, by Jiawei Li.\n\nJiawei revisits the famous Hidden Matching Problem, which is known to have an exponential gap between its randomized one-way communication complexity of ~√n, and its quantum one-way communication complexity of ~log(n). He makes a new observation about this problem: namely, if you want the exponential quantum communication advantage, then you must content yourself with a protocol that can generate many different possible correct answers with appreciable probabilities (i.e., that generates large min-entropy). In other words, no good quantum protocol for the problem is pseudodeterministic. This complements, for example, my and Shih-Han Hung’s work, which showed the same statement for quantum supremacy experiments based on Random Circuit Sampling, or the long line of works that showed it for experiments that violate the Bell/CHSH inequality.\n\nCongratulations to my students for their accomplishments, and thanks to them for giving me permission to include their work in this showcase!\n\nBy Scott\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Zixi Cai, Kuowen Chen, Shengquan Du, Arnold Filtser, Seth Pettie, Daniel Skora\n\nIn this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by\nthe infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed,\nwe have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$,\nand hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\\pm\no(1))|u-v|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each\nattractive in its own way.\n* Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive,\nnon-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid.\nDistances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove\nthat the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is\n$(1+1/\\Theta(\\log^\\xi \\log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and\n$\\xi=\\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can\nbe improved quantitatively.\n* Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of\n“highways.” It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which\nconverges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.\n* The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to\nsample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\\mathscr{D}$.\nWhether there exists a distribution $\\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances\nEuclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the\ntheory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when\n$\\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\\% of\nEuclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be\nachieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75\nwith probability 44\\% and 56\\%, respectively.\n\nRead original post\n"

For a long time I have been advocating that, for algorithmic problems involving constrained sequences, you should generalize the constraints from partial orders (an item can only be included after all its prerequisites) to antimatroids (an item can be included whenever any of multiple prerequisite sets are satisfied). This idea is not original to me: I got it from Jean-Claude Falmagne, who applied it to ordering the lessons in educational software long before he persuaded me to join his efforts.

I linked a paper on this, “Fast and simple sorting using partial information” by Haepler et al, last year.\n\n    The new algorithm is again a variation of heapsort. It maintains a heap of the items that the antimatroid allows to be next in the order, and repeatedly uses the heap to find the minimum of these items and add it to the sorted order, possibly releasing more items to be next and adding them to the heap. The preprint shows that (with the same assumptions on the heap as Haeupler et al) this gives an optimal number of comparisons for the given antimatroid (whatever that optimum might be) and discusses how to implement it efficiently for various specific antimatroids.

      "content": "Authors: Shreya Arya, Justin Curry\n\nThe persistent homology transform (PHT) of a subset $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$\nis a map $\\text{PHT}(M):\\mathbb{S}^{d-1} \\to \\mathbf{Dgm}$ from the unit sphere\nto the space of persistence diagrams. This map assigns to each direction $v\\in\n\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ the persistent homology of the filtration of $M$ in direction\n$v$. In practice, one can only sample the map $\\text{PHT}(M)$ at a finite set\nof directions $A \\subset \\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. This suggests two natural\nquestions: (1) Can we interpolate the PHT from this finite sample of directions\nto the entire sphere? If so, (2) can we prove that the resulting interpolation\nis close to the true PHT? In this paper we show that if we can sample the PHT\nat the module level, where we have information about how homology from each\ndirection interacts, a ready-made interpolation theory due to Bubenik, de\nSilva, and Nanda using Kan extensions can answer both of these questions in the\naffirmative. A close inspection of those techniques shows that we can infer the\nPHT from a finite sample of heights from each direction as well.

Their construction works when the distribution has large min-entropy $k=(1-\\gamma) \\cdot n$, for small constant $\\gamma&gt;0$.\nRecent works build on the approach of [TV00]. [BDGM23] obtain the same result under the weaker assumption that there is a problem in $\\mathsf{E}$ that is hard for exponential size nondeterministic circuits. [BSS25] and [Sha25] improve the min-entropy threshold to $k = n^{1-\\gamma}$ and $k = n^{\\Omega(1)}$ respectively, reinstating oracle access to $\\Sigma_i^{P}$ for some $i$ in the assumption.\nWe introduce a new approach, inspired by constructions of two-source extractors [CZ16,BADTS17], using a new (and incomparable) hardness assumption that only involves deterministic circuits. Our approach reduces the task of constructing extractors for samplable distributions to constructing explicit non-malleable extractors with short seed-length.\nOur new assumption has the same flavor as the classic assumption of [IW97] that $\\mathsf{E}$ is hard for exponential size circuits, and similar to one recently considered in the context of fast derandomization [CT21]. Specifically, we assume that there is a constant $0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1$ such that for every constant $C_{hard} \\ge 1$, there exists a constant $C_{easy}$ and a problem in $DTIME(2^{C_{easy} \\cdot n})$ that is not in $DTIME(2^{C_{hard} \\cdot n})/2^{\\alpha\\cdot n}$. The key feature here is that we\nallow the ``adversary’’ to run in time larger than $2^{n}$ while still only using less than $2^n$ bits of nonuniformity.\nUnder this assumption, we use currently known constructions of non-malleable extractors to get the following results:\n\n  An extractor for samplable distributions with min-entropy $k$ slightly larger than $n/2$. This is the first construction of any such extractor under an assumption that does not give the adversary nondeterminism.\n  An extractor for samplable distributions with min-entropy $k=O(\\log n \\cdot \\log \\log n)$ also follows if, in addition to the new assumption, we also have the aforementioned assumption of [BDGM23], namely, that $E$ is hard for exponential size nondeterministic circuits. This is the first construction in the regime of $k \\le poly log n$ under any assumption.\nWe also show that future improvements of the seed length of the best current non-malleable extractors [Li17] would imply the second result without the additional assumption.\nOur key observation is that when a given source is samplable, the set of bad'' seeds to a non-malleable extractor is efficiently recognizable. We utilize this observation to show that in the constructions of two-source extractors in [CZ16,BADTS17], we can hope to replace thesecond source’’ with (the truth table of) a sufficiently hard function. Thus our work reveals an unexpected connection between two-source extractors and extractors for samplable distributions, similar to Trevisan’s connection between extractors and PRGs ``in the other direction.’’\n\n\nRead original post\n"

(The lecture in Ethereum Foundation was in connection with the company’s hesitation about post-quantum cryptography; and some questions were related to this matter.) I conclude with a recent question (over FB) from Aram Harrow, who was my partner in a year-long debate in 2012.\n\nPerimeter Institute, Dec. 2022 (video); Three questions by Ray Laflamme.\n\nI recently heard the sad news that Ray Laflamme passed away. Ray Laflamme was an eminent researcher in both the theoretical and the experimental aspects of quantum computing. Here are  links to beautiful tributes to Ray by Scott Aaronson, and by Nicole Yunger Halpern.  I met Ray in person only once, at a 2013 conference QSTART, which we organized in Jerusalem to inaugurate our Quantum Science Center.\n\nIn my lecture at PI (click for abstract and video), Ray  (at 55:10) started the discussion with the following three questions:\n\nQ1: In your “goal number three,” you mentioned surface codes, and and there were very nice experiments from the summer (2022) that Google published with surface codes of distance 3 with 17 qubits and another one of distance 5 with 49 qubits. They showed that by using distance 5 they had a slight improvement of the effective error rate. Would this experiment, if it becomes better and go to distance 7 and 9, shed doubts on your argument that quantum computers are impossible?\n\nQ2: About the lowest realistic possible rate of noise that you refer to as a fundamental constant of nature (   ); do you have a number for that?\n\nQ3: Does this putative “constant of nature” tells us there is something wrong with quantum mechanics?\n\nThere were a several follow-up questions and comments including by Lee Smolin and by Debbie Leung (for Ray’s Q3) and by Latham Boyle (who hosted the lecture) and others (for Ray’s Q2). Latham asked about the details of the argument that I presented in the lecture in order to verify that it is not circular—namely, he questioned whether the argument implicitly assumes that gate errors cannot be decreased below the threshold in order to derive this as a conclusion. (I explained why the argument is indeed not circular.)\n\n\n\nA question from me to Ray Laflamme in our QSTART conference, July 2013; Ray gave a beautiful opening talk on experimental quantum error correction.\n\nPhysics colloquium hosted by Daniel Friedan in Rutgers University, 2022\n\nIn October 2022, I gave the physics colloquium at Rutgers University. Here is the video recording.\n\nQ4 Pierre [Coleman]: The crucial test for any theory in physics is whether it can be falsified. I did not see in all your proposals how we can test if your theory is correct or false. Do you have a proposed experiment?\n\nQ5 Scott [Thomas]: How do your ideas impact proposals for topological quantum computers?\n\nQ6 Tom Banks: Why is it hard to compute permanents (in view of techniques that apply to Gaussian ensembles and are used for quantum field theory)?\n\nQ7 Ananda Roy: Isn’t the bulb describing your computational class LDP getting larger and larger with smaller error rates?\n\nQ8 Daniel Friedan: Physicists have a tendency to regard any mathematical theorem referring to their work as a challenge to evade the theorem’s assumptions. In this spirit, would a very special local form of noise for boson sampling evade the conclusion of your theorem?\n\nThe Quantum Duel with Matthias Christandl\n\n\n\nHere are some questions from the duel. The quantum duel with Matthias and the entire week organized by the Czech Learned Society were thought-provoking, and I will devote a special post to it. Q9-Q23 below were raised and discussed in the second hour of the debate.\n\nQ9 (from the audience to Gil): You claimed that there is a fundamental obstacle to quantum computation; it was not concrete, what is the nature of your objection.\n\nQ10  (Matthias to Gil): You claim that noise will remain above a certain constant. If true this will be an obstacle. What is the number?! (Once we have the number, we have it now on tape, we can see in a few years if we beat this number, yes or no!\n\nQ10 (Follow-up question from Matthias): Now, that I got this number, how does this constant come from quantum physics (or from some modification of quantum mechanics)?!\n\nQ11 (Martin Loebl, our host, addressed  to both of us): Why do these quantum computers (and quantum error-correction) not exist in nature?\n\nQ12 Ronald de Wolf to Gil (from chat): Noisy classical circuits are a special class of noisy quantum circuits. If noisy quantum circuits can only compute some low level complexity class then the same should be true for noisy classical circuits.  (In other words, if quantum computation is not possible why is classical computation possible?)\n\nQ13 (from chat to Mathias): Do you believe that Majorana Zero Modes can generate topological quantum qubits?\n\nQ14: (Alexander Zykov): Let’s assume that the noisy quantum circuits will always remain noisy (above the threshold). Can we still use them for accelerating classical computation or achieving useful approximations?\n\nQ15 (to Gil): Do Google’s 2024 error correcting codes falsify your argument?\n\nQ16 to Matthias: Earlier you claimed that we are quantum computers. Can you please factor 1522605027922533360535618378132637429718068114961380688657908494580122963258952897654000350692006139?\n\nQ17 Implementations are energy-inefficient, at least for ion trapped quantum computation.  Wouldn’t this be a problem for scaling?\n\nQ18 Can “expectation bias”  cause researchers and the community to misjudge the quality of experiments?\n\nQ19 How large numbers can we factor in 10 years?\n\nQ20 (Marc Mézard): We do have efficient quantum devices; Is it possible, then, that QC in the next 50 years will achieve only niche computation and not universal quantum computation?\n\nQ21 Given Gil’s argument about  NISQ systems,  Why isn’t it considered an open and shut case? Why do we still have debate? Why is this argument dismissed by the experts?\n\nQ22  (to Gil:) What is the significance of the intermediate scale in your argument?\n\nQ23 (to Matthias) With quantum computers will we observe superposition of macroscopic systems?\n\nSome additional questions were asked in chat during the live streaming but we did not get to them in the debate itself. (I wrote my answers to some of them and they are presented in the debate’s website.)\n\nQ 24 (Addressed to both Gil and Matthias, from chat): Why do both of you regard the claims about quantum topological qubits as unconvincing.\n\nQ25 (to Gil): From what I understand, you believe this is an engineering challenge and not exactly a matter of physics (theoretical, to be precise). If yes, should not the debate involve a quantum engineer?\n\nQ26 (to both): Could you both debate more about where your models of quantum computers differ? How is it possible that you reach different conclusions?\n\nQ27  (Addressed to both participants): Two-qubit gates always involve non-computational states, introducing a tradeoff between speed, leakage and errors (when “fixing” the leakage). That might be a microscopic origin of irreducible noise. Do we have definite knowledge about the impact of non-computational states on the error rates?\n\nQ28   to Gil: in your answer to Ronald you mentioned that LDP of NISQ is not an obstacle to harder classical computation. Why may it also NOT be an obstacle to fault-tolerant quantum computation? What is your precise argument for why easiness of NISQ implies impossibility of quantum fault-tolerance?\n\nQ29 Jiří Kolafa to both: If we combine n physical qubits into one logical qubit, how does the noise reduce? As poly(1/n) or exp(-kn)? In the 2nd case, I believe q computing…\n\nQ30 “Dulwich Quantum” to both: Will quantum computers solve climate change?\n\nQ31 (to Gil):  Do I understand correctly that the claim that NISQ devices are limited to some computational class is based on experimental results from NISQ devices? Does this necessarily apply to all possible quantum hardware? Why would this imply that a fault tolerant computer couldn’t be built at all?\n\nQ32: Prof. Kalai, I understand your argument as follows: because of an assumed complexity barrier, there is an engineering barrier. Is that correct? If so, assuming that fault-tolerant CQ are built, will it imply fundamental progress in complexity theory?\n\nQ33 (to Gil): Large parts of computational complexity are based on certain computational complexity hypotheses. Isn’t it too brave to dismiss the existence of quantum computers based on something we are not sure is actually correct?\n\nNextSilicon\n\nI gave a lecture on the quantum computing debate at NextSilicon, hosted by Jonathan Devor and Oded Margalit, and there were many good questions both during the official (recorded) question period and afterwards. The video of the lecture is here. Since I neglected to send a title and abstract, my hosts generously filled the gap with the dramatic headline: “Doomed to Fail: Why Quantum Supremacy Is Not the Future of Computing.” When I saw it I suggested a more neutral title, but, apparently, for a few days, this title caused some small panic and led to protests from technology funds with investments in quantum computing.\n\nQ34: Can you say a word or two on the Fourier analysis?\n\nQ35: What about the recent declarations of experiments using the Google Willow quantum computers\n\nQ36: Most of the applications of classical computers are based on heuristics. Do you expect heuristics that will allow further applications of quantum computers.\n\nAnother question (Q37) that I was asked after the lecture was whether Gentry’s fully homomorphic encryption scheme can be a basis for quantum fault-tolerance methods.\n\nEthereum Foundation’s lecture\n\nUsually my policy is not to get involved in policy matters about quantum computation and let my papers speak for themselves. (I did make a small exception in this post where I proposed to wait before any implementation of post-quantum cryptography until there is a firm demonstration of DiVincenzo stages 3–4.) However, when Matan Prasma asked me to talk at the Ethereum Foundation in connection with the company’s hesitation about post-quantum cryptography, I decided to make another exception, largely because of my appreciation for Matan from his days as a brilliant student at HUJI. The lecture titled A Critical Look on Quantum Computing (click for You Tube) briefly described both my assessment of where we stand now and my argument regarding what we can expect in the future.\n\nQ38: When do you expect we will know with high assurance whether quantum computers are possible?\n\nQ39: What is your opinion on recent progress on squeezing states and error correction?\n\nQ40: More generally, from a risk management point of view, how should existing crypto systems prepare (or should they not) for quantum computing (being akin to meteorite risk: low probability, high impact)?”\n\nQ41: Is it possible to build quantum computers outside the NISQ paradigm?\n\nQ42: What would a compelling experiment look like to you, one that might start challenge your current beliefs?\n\nQ43: what about the possibility of fantastic achievements that are kept secret for national security reasons?\n\nQ44: Can you repeat the argument that NISQ systems are confined to a low complexity class LDP?\n\nQ45: Can error-pruned noisy quantum computers still reduce the amount of work needed to break certain crypto systems or be useful for some other computational purposes? Can NISQ computers be useful before fault-tolerant quantum computers?\n\nQ46: We heard that the progress in quantum computing depends on the engineering effort invested in the project and once we pass a certain limit we can expect a “Manhattan-type” investment. What do you think about that?\n\nQ47: Gil, why do you think people working in this field disagree with you? \nWhy is it the case that experts in quantum computations are not convinced by your argument?\n\nA blast from the past: Facebook discussion with Aram Harrow (July, 2025)\n\nAram and I conducted a year-long debate in 2012 about quantum fault tolerance and later met in 2013 at MIT. We recently “met” in a Facebook discussion comparing randomness and quantumness and ended with a cozy exchange of remarks.\n\nQ48 (Aram to Gil): Are you saying that 1409.3093 [Kalai-Kindler 2014] proved a lower bound on the achievable noise rate of linear optics?\n\n(Gil to Aram, abbreviated): Yes!\n\nBy Gil Kalai\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "A property of functions is called location-invariant (or symmetric) if it can be characterized in terms of the frequencies in which each value occurs in the function, regardless of the locations in which each value occurs.\nIt is known that the (query) complexity of testing location-invariant properties of functions\nis closely related to the (sample) complexity of testing the (corresponding properties of the) corresponding distributions.\nThe main message of the current work is that this close relationship is not maintained in the context of verification.\nThis holds both when considering verification by general interactive proofs of proximity (i.e., IPPs) and when restricting attention to doubly-sublinear IPPs (ds-IPPs).\nAlternatively, one may view this work as a subsequent step in the study of doubly-sublinear IPPs (of properties of functions), where we say that an IPP is doubly-sublinear if (1) the query complexity of the verifier is sublinear in the query complexity of testing the property, and (2) the query complexity of the honest prover is sublinear in the query complexity of learning a function in the property.\nSpecifically, we present doubly-sublinear IPPs for several natural location-invariant properties. Our results include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nWe present doubly-sublinear IPPs for the set of functions from $[m]$ to $[n]$\nin which each value occurs $m/n$ times:\nFor every $\\alpha\\in(0,0.5)$, the query complexity of the verifier is $O(n^{0.5-\\alpha})$, and the query complexity of the honest prover is $\\tildeO(n^{0.5+\\alpha}/\\eps^2)$.\n\\item\nWe present doubly-sublinear IPPs for the set of functions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in which each value occurs either $m/k$ times or not at all:\nFor every $\\alpha\\in(0,1/3)$, the query complexity of the verifier is $\\poly(1/\\eps)\\cdot k^{(2/3)-2\\alpha}$, and the query complexity of the prover is $\\poly(1/\\eps)\\cdot\\tildeO(k^{(2/3)+\\alpha})$.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn contrast, in both cases, it is known that the corresponding properties of distributions\nhave no doubly-sublinear IPP (see Herman and Rothblum, 2025).\nActually, the first property of distributions (i.e., uniformity over $[n]$) does not even have an IPP in which the verifier uses $o(n^{1/2})$ samples, regardless of other complexity measures.\n\nRead original post\n"

Temporal motifs have\nbeen used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological\nnetworks.\nMotif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more\nthan four vertices.\nIn this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation\nalgorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques\nto obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.\nWe give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation\nguarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show\nthat TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU\nimplementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU\nimplementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate\nalgorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases.

Additionally, we present an\nalgorithm that maintains a constant-factor approximation sparsifier of size\n$O(n \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$ against an adaptive adversary for\n$O(\\text{polylog}(n))$-partially symmetrized graphs, a notion introduced in\n[Kyng-Meierhans-Probst Gutenberg ‘22]. A $\\beta$-partial symmetrization of a\ndirected graph $\\vec{G}$ is the union of $\\vec{G}$ and $\\beta \\cdot G$, where\n$G$ is the corresponding undirected graph of $\\vec{G}$. This algorithm also\nachieves a polylogarithmic amortized update time.\nMoreover, we develop a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a cut\nsparsifier for $\\beta$-balanced directed graphs, where the ratio between\nweighted incoming and outgoing edges of any cut is at most $\\beta$. This\nalgorithm explicitly maintains a cut sparsifier of size\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\beta n \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$ in worst-case update time\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\beta \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$.\n\nRead original post\n"

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency\nwhile maintaining quality under full dynamism.\n\nRead original post\n"

The principal must design\na contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In\nthis work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which\ntransforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)\nto tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach\ndiverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an\nassumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.\nWe first show how to “lift” the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the\nbest-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design\nproblem. We establish this through our “local-global” framework, in which the\n“local” step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem. The “global” step then utilizes the local one to find the\napproximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of\ncombinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted\nmatroid, and budgeted matching constraints.

Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an\nuncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each\nedge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The\nuncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an\nuncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is\nlower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of\n$G$ into planar graphs.

Heterogeneous systems, integrating\ntraditional multi-core CPUs with specialized accelerators like discrete (dGPU)\nand integrated (iGPU) graphics processing units, offer a compelling path to\nnavigating the trade-offs between performance and power.

Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially\nobservable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,\nself-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to\nmean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,\nthe probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still\nensuring net human benefit.

      "content": "Tom Lehrer passed away on Saturday July 26 at the age of 97.\n\nHe worked in both of my fields of interest: Parody Songs and Mathematics.\n\n1)  He got a BA in Mathematics from Harvard, Magna Cum Laude, in 1946.\n\n2) While he was an undergraduate he wrote an performed the song Fight Fiercely Harvardwhich was a gentle football fight song. IDEA: Use the melody to write a song about Harvard’s current fight with the Trump Administration.\n\n3) He wrote some political songs. Some were performed by Nancy Ames on the British Satirical Show That was the week That Was. Tom L didn’t like that probably because they cut some of the more controversial lyrics. He later wrote and performed songs for another political satire show, The Frost Report Here are some of his political songs and comments on them:\n\nWho’s Next - about which countries have or will have nuclear weapons. IDEA: Update it.\n\nThe Vatican Rag- about the Catholic Church- controversial now, rather tame now. If you heard it now you won’t understand why it was ever controversial. Such is the nature of biting satire. I noticed this in an earlier post, see here.  As such, I view old political novelty songs as entertaining history.\n\n4) He went to graduate school for Math at Harvard. He worked on it on-and-off and had other jobs but left Harvard in 1965 (see his Wikipedia entry here for the full story).\n\n5) One of the things he was doing while he was at Harvard was compose, sing, and record songs. Here are the some of particular interest to my readers:\n\nNew Math - I was actually a victim or beneficiary of the new math.\n\nLobachevsky- Historically inaccurate but funny.\n\nThe Elements- This might be Tom L’s best known song. Its to the tune of  I am the very model of a  Modern Major General; however, some of the songs that use that Tune seem to be parodies of The Elements.I have a website of parodies of Modern Major General here.Unfortunately the song that is most clearly a parody of  The Elements, Dr Jane’s The Muscles of the Kitty Cat,seems to have disappeared from You Tube. It is not on Spotify. (Spellcheck thinks that Spotify is not a word.) I can’t find it anywhere on the web. I DO have it on CD.\n\nThe Decimal Song- About using base 10. This was on The Frost Report.Not on any album so you might not know this one, though it is on you tube.\n\nThat’s Mathematics- Originally written to be the theme song for a PBS math show now titled Square One Television.They did not use it. He later added a lyric about Andrew Wiles. Square One Television often features math songs. Here are my favorites: The Mathematics of Love, 8% of my love,That’s Combinatorics, Polka Patterns (by Weird Al).\n\nThat’s Mathematics sung by Mathematicians A nice tribute to him. It was done a few years ago. Tom L knew about it and was delighted.\n\nThe Derivative song I could not find on line.  It is not on any album. Oh well.\n\n6) A few years ago Tom L put his songs in the public domain, see here. That website also includes lyrics for songs that were never recorded. IDEA: Record them!\n\n7) Tom L claims to have invented Jello Shots as a way to get around alcohol-free requirements. The Great Luke Ski wrote a song about Tom L in the style of Tom L. Its not on You Tube but it is at FUMP (FUnny Music project) here (click on play on second song)\n\n8)  His singing career was fairly short. Three albums, a few tours, a few other songs. Weird Al has 14 albums, Alan Sherman has 10 albums (Alan Sherman was born four years earlier than Tom L but died in 1973). However, the percent of great song on Tom L’s albums is around 90%, whereas for Weird Al and Alan Sherman its around 60% (this is just my opinion).  Also, Tom L had a day job. He has said he never really retired from singing, he wrote when he felt like it, and over time didn’t feel like it. For what he said about retiring from singing, see his Wikipedia page here.\n\n9)  There are two  stories about Tom L I bring up - one seems to be TRUE though I thought it was FALSE, and the other IS FALSE.\n\na) He stopped political satire because:\n\nPolitical satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nI have the following (possibly false) memory:\n\nTom L has denied this and points out that he had pretty much stopped many years earlier. And I’ll point out that he wrote non-political novelty songs as well (that is Tom L did, not Henry K).\n\nBUT- Wikipedia and other sources say that its true. Who am I do disagree with the Google Gods?\n\nb) He was sued by Wernher Von Braun’s family for his song about Wernher. This is false and the web says that it is false. Tom L denied it in a 2003 interview. I have a (possibly false) memory of reading that he wished it was true because it would mean people are still listening to his music.\n\n9) On Jan 1, 2025 he became one of the rare people who:\n\n– Lived during two square years (1936 and 2025).\n\n– Was of age and mental ability to appreciate that they had done this\n\nI had a blog on people who lived through 2 square years here.\n\n10) I end with what might have been his last song\n\nI’m spending Hanukkah in Santa Monica\n\nBy gasarch\n\nRead original post\n"

This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific\ncomputing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and\ninversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order\noptimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work\nfocuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning\nspecific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.\nWe initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to\nunderstand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix\nfamilies. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to\n$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\\mathcal{F}$. Standard results\nfrom matrix sketching show that $O(\\log|\\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice\nin this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for\nvector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have\nbeen widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.\nSurprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a\nnearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log|\\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is\ntight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends\nto well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a\nnear-optimal approximation from any \\emph{linear matrix family} of dimension\n$q$ can be learned with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an\n$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector\nqueries.\n\nRead original post\n"

An alternative\nobjective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,\nnamely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a\nbudget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation\nguarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,\nrather than the increase).

Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We\ninstantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate\nits effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings\nfrom prior research on BERT’s embedding properties across various layers of its\narchitecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of\ntopological neighborhoods.\n\nRead original post\n"

First, a catalog of quality criteria for these\nsubdivision algorithms is developed, serving as a guideline for the\nconstruction process.\nThe construction begins by generating the desired subdominant eigenvectors as\nthe vertices of regular convex 3-polytopes for volumes using circle packings.\nSubsequently, these polytopes are utilized to construct a\nColin-de-Verdiere-matrix for the generalized quadratic and a\nColin-de-Verdiere-like matrix for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision.\nThese matrices are then adjusted using the matrix exponential to obtain\nsubdivision matrices with the desired properties.\nAll subdivision algorithms introduced in this paper empirically exhibit a\nsubdominant eigenvalue of 1/2 with the desired algebraic and geometric\nmultiplicity. For the quadratic case, this property can even be formally\nproven. Moreover, the corresponding eigenvectors form a convex polytope in the\ncentral region for the generalized quadratic B-spline subdivision algorithms,\nwhile for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision algorithms, they represent\nthe refinement of a convex polytope. Additionally, the constructed subdivision\nalgorithms fulfill various other quality criteria, such as affine invariance\nand convex hull preservation and respecting all symmetries. Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated that the original Catmull-Clark algorithm is not suitable for\ngeneralization to volumetric subdivision and that the established subdivision\nalgorithms [Baj+02] and [JM99] do not exhibit a suitable spectrum for several\ncombinatorial configurations.

Some humans DID solve it.\n\na) Some comments suggested that an AI should be able to list several ways the lists differ, and have probabilities of which ones are sensible.  My take: maybe in the future but not now.\n\nb) Is this kind of question fair to ask an AI (or for that matter a person). They have to guess what I have in mind.

That’s correct. So\nview this blog post as the starting point: study how AI’s do on this question\nand others like it, keeping track of which AI and how the question is posed. Then we will have a better sense.\n\n9) Is this a sign that AI is not as good as people think OR is it just a hiccup?\n\nBy gasarch\n\nRead original post\n"

Seshadhri, Nishil Talati\n\nMotif counting is a fundamental problem in network analysis, and there is a\nrich literature of theoretical and applied algorithms for this problem. Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small “pattern” graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a “triadic” query. Recent\nwork has focused on “temporal graph mining”, where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\nInspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n“thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis” for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An “FOL” motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be “find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour”. A thresholded FOL query can express “find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour”.\nWe design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has\nexcellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with\nnearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the\npotential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem\nof motif analysis.\n\nRead original post\n"

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and\nexhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of\nruntime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential\nimprovement in best-case scenarios. This paper is an extended version of [1],\nwith three more algorithms proposed.\n\nRead original post\n"

The longest unbordered\nfactor is a fundamental notion in stringology, closely related to string\nperiodicity. This paper addresses the longest unbordered factor problem: given\na string of length $n$, the goal is to compute its longest factor that is\nunbordered. While recent work has achieved subquadratic and near-linear time\nalgorithms for this problem, the best known worst-case time complexity remains\n$O(n \\log n)$ [Kociumaka et al., ISAAC 2018]. In this paper, we investigate the\nproblem in the context of compressed string processing, particularly focusing\non run-length encoded (RLE) strings. We first present a simple yet crucial\nstructural observation relating unbordered factors and RLE-compressed strings.\nBuilding on this, we propose an algorithm that solves the problem in $O(m^{1.5}\n\\log^2 m)$ time and $O(m \\log^2 m)$ space, where $m$ is the size of the\nRLE-compressed input string. To achieve this, our approach simulates a key idea\nfrom the $O(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm by [Gawrychowski et al., SPIRE 2015],\nadapting it to the RLE setting through new combinatorial insights.

Traditional approaches focus\neither on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic\nallocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these\napproaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized\nallocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported\non approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that\nunder additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is\nex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one\ngood (EF1).\nOur work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness\nguarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful\nex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:\n1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive\nvaluations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed\nefficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally\nincompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark.\nWe then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO\ntogether with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and\nleverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.\n2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX\nwhere some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated\npool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante\n0.5-EF.\n3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post\nguarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of\nagents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to\n0.5-proportionality.\n\nRead original post\n"

If only you could see the horror of my Google Docs folder. I periodically force myself to collect draft documents in the hope that this archiving will be useful for later final projects. This blog, which I consider a public repository of first drafts, is no exception. If you use the Substack app or only get argmin by email, you probably never see the doors to the archives. But since I was trying to collect my posts this week, I thought some of you might enjoy a tour.\n\nI used to run this blog through github, and all of those old posts are still around, but now you have to append “archives” to the URL: archives.argmin.net.\n\nIf you go to argmin.net and scroll down a bit, you’ll see a link here:\n\n\n\nI can’t figure out how to convince the Substack CMS to put this link higher on the page. Oh well. It’s also linked on the “About” page that no one visits. Regardless, the whole Jekyll blog structure remains intact at the link. If, for example, you wanted to read my survey of reinforcement learning for control applications, it’s here in all of its glory. I still get requests for these old posts and have tried to make them easy to find. Google, of course, refuses to reindex them. Oh well!\n\nOn the top banner, I have some other links to Substack posts I’ve collected thematically.\n\n\n\nMy course lecture blogging has its own tab, and each course has its own webpage. You can revisit, for example, my original live blogging of my graduate machine learning class in 2023.\n\nI also have collected some posts into themes. An index of my Meehl blogging is linked there. These remind me that I need to find someone else’s class to blog through next summer. It’s fun and I highly recommend it. If you still lurk around on Twitter, you should follow Damek Davis, who is tweeting through Percy Liang’s “Language Models from Scratch” class, which has been an incredible public service.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start, I was trying to figure out how to collect the blogs I’ve written this summer into themes, and I’m not sure any theme has been coherent enough to warrant its own page. But here’s my attempt at collecting them.\n\nA prominent theme this summer was forecasting. I wrote three posts (post 1, post 2, post 3) introducing the defensive forecasting survey I wrote with Juanky Perdomo. I followed this up with a post on the politics of forecasting. I also wrote about methodological challenges in forecasts, like when hedge funds try to convince people they have secret AI sauce but have just reinvented local weighted averaging. And though my post isn’t explicitly about forecasting, I did write about that METR study that compared forecasts to measurements of AI productivity gains. Though more about machine learning in general, last week’s post on why it’s hard to “prove” unpredictability fits into this theme.\n\nI also found myself writing a lot of academic navel gazing. There were about ten posts about scientific culture and gatekeeping. I had a fun four-post series on the history of academic computer science. I read through Louis Fein’s pitch to the ACM to create computer science departments and how computer scientists created a mythology around the field’s origins. I also looked into how Fein was written out of the history of CS, and how his speculative vision for the future of computer science was boring and bureaucratic.\n\nI wrote about scientific communal notions of validity and how they are more cultural style guides than divining rods of epistemological truth. I read Neil Postman’s “Social Science as Moral Theology,” which partially explains why social science feels the need to rest its rhetoric so heavily on quantitative constructs.2 I tried to thread the needle between how expertise is created and curated communally by academics but that doesn’t necessitate our current broken system of pre-publication peer review. And on a theme I want to revisit soon, I wrote about how metaanalysis of statistical significance is deeply confounded by the complex dynamic feedback mechanisms of academic expertise creation. In fact, the more I look into crises in science, the more I find that science has always been a mess. Trying to gatekeep that mess is and has been largely unproductive.\n\nFinally, and I suppose quite thematically related, I spent a lot of time on the state of academic machine learning. I worry about its focus on bureaucratic (and statistical) gatekeeping rather than open data and models. I asked what it would take for academics to re-engage with fully open generative AI. A third post tried to tie this argument together. These posts have me doing a lot of soul searching about my research future.\n\nHousekeeping note: I’ll be traveling for the next couple of weeks and won’t be posting while I’m away. I’ll be back the first week of August. I have a queue of ideas for what I want to write that I’ll get back to when I return, and hopefully they won’t be too outdated by then. The discourse moves fast these days! I’ll see you in August.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nRereading these, I wonder if I should write a 2025 version of this surveying the role of “RL” in language modeling. I’m sort of thinking I should. It at least deserves a blog post!\n\n2\n\nThough not from this summer, this post about Healy and Fourcade’s The Ordinal Society is closely related.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

The resulting formulation offers\nimproved behavior in both theoretical and applied settings.To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to systematically apply persistent homology\nto social choice systems, providing a mathematically grounded method for\ncomparing topological summaries of voting structures and preference dynamics.\nWe demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments,\nincluding robustness tests and supervised learning tasks, and we propose a\nmodular pipeline for building predictive models from online preference data.\nThis work contributes a conceptually novel and computationally effective tool\nto the emerging interface of topology and decision theory, opening new\ndirections in interpretable machine learning for political and economic\nsystems.\n\nRead original post\n"

The heads read the input in opposite directions and the computation\nfinishes when the heads meet. These automata accept the class LIN of linear\nlanguages. The deterministic counterpart of these models, on the one hand, is\nless expressive, as only a proper subset of LIN, the class 2detLIN is accepted;\nand on the other hand, they are also equivalent in the sense of the class of\nthe accepted languages. Now, based on these automata models, we characterize\nthe class of 2detLIN languages with a Myhill-Nerode type of equivalence\nclasses. However, as these automata may do the computation of both the prefix\nand the suffix of the input, we use prefix-suffix pairs in our classes.\nAdditionally, it is proven that finitely many classes in the characterization\nmatch with the 2detLIN languages, but we have some constraints on the used\nprefix-suffix pairs, i.e., the characterization should have the property to be\ncomplete and it must not have any crossing pairs.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Today’s technical post is by Arsen Vasilyan. This focuses on the very exciting new “testable learning” he introduced with Rubinfeld in a 2023 paper. There’s been a flurry of work since then, so this is a good chance to catch up in case you’re behind!\n\n\n\n1. The Goal: Learning with Noisy Labels\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nMany learning algorithms simply stop working when some of the training examples are mislabeled. For example, suppose we are using a linear program to learn a linear classifier. Then, a single mislabeled data-point can make the linear program infeasible, and the algorithm fails to output a solution. Today, we will discuss how to design learning algorithms that are provably robust to such noise.\n\nFor noise-resistant learning algorithms, a key consideration emerges: what can these algorithms assume about how the data-points are distributed? We will discuss three theoretical frameworks addressing this question:\n\n\n  Framework 1 — the distribution-free framework — makes no assumption on how data-points are generated. For every distribution over datapoints, the algorithm has to run efficiently and be robust to noise. This framework is very well-understood, but is computationally intractable. Even the simplest concept classes lead to computationally hard learning tasks in this framework.\n  Framework 2 — the distribution-specific framework — assumes that data-points come from some well-behaved distribution, such as the Gaussian distribution. Over the last 30 years, the distribution-specific framework has led to a wealth of provably efficient algorithms. However, these algorithms fail to be noise-resistant when their assumptions do not hold.\n  Framework 3 — the testable framework — relies on an assumption on the data-point distribution only for the run-time of an algorithm, but not for the algorithm’s robustness to noise. Even if data-points do not come from some well-behaved distribution, the algorithm should be robust to noise. However, in this case, the algorithm might take a long time to run.\n\n\nThis blog post will mostly focus on the third framework, which was recently introduced in [RV ’23] in the context of learning with noise, and further explored in [GKK ’23, DKKLZ ’23, GKSV ’23, GKSV ’24, GSSV ’24, DKLZ’24, STW ’24, GKSV ’25]. In brief, although Framework 3 is more stringent than Framework 2, there is a toolkit of techniques that we can use to upgrade many Framework 2 algorithms into Framework 3.\n\n1.2 FAQ on the Testable Framework (Framework 3)\n\nWe get a lot of questions about Framework 3, and so we begin with the following FAQs:\n\n\n  Q: Why is the framework called testable? \nA: All current algorithms in Framework 3 follow the following general recipe for upgrading Framework 2 algorithms into Framework 3 — the procedure suggests the name testable learning. See Section 2.2 for more about this recipe.\n    \n      a) Run a Framework 2 algorithm and obtain a hypothesis .\n      b) Run a tester that is guaranteed to output “accept” whenever the assumption holds.\n      c) If the tester accepted, return the hypothesis .\n      d) Otherwise, the assumption must have been violated so we can run a computationally expensive algorithm (See Section 1.3 for more about those).\n    \n  \n  Q: To implement this tester, cant we just check that the distribution is “close” to a Gaussian using tools from distribution testing? \nA: For many notions of “closeness” this is statistically impossible: for example one cannot test whether an unknown distribution is Gaussian or far from Gaussian in total variation distance.1 For other notions of closeness, such as the earth-mover distance, these tools require a number of samples and run-time that is exponential in the dimension. In learning theory, we are looking for much faster run-times (see [RV ’23] for more discussion).\n  Q: What if the assumption is violated only slightly? I am concerned that this will cause a Framework 3 algorithm to run slowly as a result. \nA: Many algorithms in Framework 3 can be modified to run fast whenever the assumption is only approximately satisfied in total variation distance [GKSV ’25]. This setting is called Tolerant Testable Learning, and discussed more in Section 3.2.\n  Q: The algorithm is guaranteed to run fast for only one specific distribution. What if I want it to run fast for an entire family of distributions? \nA: This setting, called universal testable learning, has also been studied. [GKSV ’23] studies it for the family of log-concave distributions, and it turns out to be intimately connected with Sum-of-Squares relaxations [KS17].\n  Q: Framework 3 is defined to work with learning under label noise (a.k.a. agnostic learning). What about (noise-free) PAC learning? \nA: Frameworks 2 and 3 are essentially equivalent in the noise-free setting. In this setting, one can always tell whether the learning algorithm successfully produced a good hypothesis: just estimate its prediction error by drawing a fresh set of examples. If the prediction error is large, this must be because the assumption is violated, so Framework 3 does not require us to run fast. In this case, we can produce a classifier by running a computationally expensive algorithm (See Section 1.3 for more about those).\n  Q: What is the sample complexity of this framework? Is it related to VC dimension? \nA: [GKK ’23]have shown that the sample complexity of this model is characterized by the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class. However, in this blog post we will focus on the run-time rather than sample complexity.\n\n\nWe will now introduce the three frameworks in more detail, survey more of the known results and highlight general ideas for designing such algorithms.\n\n1.3 Three Frameworks for Learning with Noisy Labels\n\nLet us be more formal now.  will denote our hypothesis class, containing binary-valued functions over the domain . We get independent examples  from a distribution  and each  is labeled bysome unknown binary-valuedfunction2 . To model arbitrary label noise, we place no assumption on , and our goal is to get as close as possible to the smallest error among all functions  from the class :\n\n![\\displaystyle \\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}:=\\min{f\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\underbrace{\\Pr_{x\\sim D_{\\text{Examples}}}[f(x)\\neq f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x)]}{\\text{Prediction error of \\ensuremath{f}.}}. ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%3A%3D%5Cmin_%7Bf%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%5Cunderbrace%7B%5CPr_%7Bx%5Csim+D_%7B%5Ctext%7BExamples%7D%7D%7D%5Bf%28x%29%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x%29%5D%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BPrediction+error+of+%5Censuremath%7Bf%7D.%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n\nFor instance, ![{\\text{opt}{\\text{Linear Classifiers}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BLinear+Classifiers%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) denotes the smallest classification error achievable by any linear classifier.\n\n\n\nFramework 1 [Distribution-free Framework] For any distribution  and function , the learning algorithm should run in time  and with high probability3 output a classifier  with\n\n![\\displaystyle \\overbrace{\\Pr_{x\\sim D_{\\text{Examples}}}[h(x)\\neq f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x)]}^{\\text{Prediction error of \\ensuremath{h}.}}\\leq\\underbrace{\\overbrace{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}}^{\\text{Optimal prediction error in \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}.}}}+\\varepsilon}{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{Weaker guarantees, such as O(\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}})+\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon},\\ also considered.}}}}}}}. ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Coverbrace%7B%5CPr%7Bx%5Csim+D_%7B%5Ctext%7BExamples%7D%7D%7D%5Bh%28x%29%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x%29%5D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BPrediction+error+of+%5Censuremath%7Bh%7D.%7D%7D%5Cleq%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Coverbrace%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BOptimal+prediction+error+in+%5Censuremath%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D.%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7BWeaker+guarantees%2C+such+as+O%28%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%29%2B%5Censuremath%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D%2C%5C+also+considered.%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n\n\n\nThis task, also known as agnostic learning, can be solved sample-efficiently. According to a central theorem in the VC theory,  samples suffice (where  is the VC dimension of ). For example, if  is the class of linear classifiers, then , so  samples are enough.\n\nHowever, when considering the run-time , the Framework 1 is revealed to be intractable. For example, no -time algorithm is known in Framework 1 when  is taken to be the class of linear classifiers (which is arguably the most basic hypothesis class).

What happens if  is some specific commonly-occurring probability distribution? For instance, we may want to find a good linear classifier when the data-points come from a Gaussian distribution or some other well-behaved distribution .

For many natural choices of distribution , the aforementioned hardness results for Framework 1 can be sidestepped in Framework 2. When the class  is the class of linear classifiers and the distribution  is a Gaussian distribution, the algorithm of [KKMS ’08, DGJSV ’10] can achieve an error ![{\\text{opt}{\\text{Linear Classifiers}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BLinear+Classifiers%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) with run-time , which is a lot better than the  run-time in Framework 1. This run-time is believed to be optimal [DKZ ’20, GGK ’20, DKPZ ’21, DKR ’23], but can be sped up to  if one is happy with a slightly larger error4 of ![{O(\\text{opt}{\\text{Linear Classifiers}})+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BLinear+Classifiers%7D%7D%29%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) [ABL ’14, DKTZ ’22].\n\nYet, Framework 2 relies on the potentially unverifiable assumption that the distribution  equals . Note that it is impossible to verify whether  is exactly equal to the Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, when , the ![{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) error guarantee of an algorithm in Framework 2 becomes null and void. Remember how a linear-programming approach can fully fail to find a linear classifier with even a single mislabeled example? We see that Framework 2 also permits an algorithm to fully fail when .\n\nThis limitation is addressed by the following more challenging framework, in which the algorithm must always output a near-optimal classifier (with high probability, as in Framework 1) but must run quickly only when the assumption holds (as in Framework 2):\n\n\n\nFramework 3 [Testable Framework] For any distribution  and function , the learning algorithm should with high probability output a classifier  with\n\n![\\displaystyle \\overbrace{\\Pr_{x\\sim D_{\\text{Examples}}}[h(x)\\neq f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x)]}^{\\text{Prediction error of \\ensuremath{h}.}}\\leq\\underbrace{\\overbrace{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}}^{\\text{Optimal prediction error in \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}.}}}+\\varepsilon}{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{Weaker guarantees, such as O(\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}})+\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon},\\ also considered.}}}}. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Coverbrace%7B%5CPr%7Bx%5Csim+D_%7B%5Ctext%7BExamples%7D%7D%7D%5Bh%28x%29%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x%29%5D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BPrediction+error+of+%5Censuremath%7Bh%7D.%7D%7D%5Cleq%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Coverbrace%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BOptimal+prediction+error+in+%5Censuremath%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D.%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7BWeaker+guarantees%2C+such+as+O%28%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%29%2B%5Censuremath%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D%2C%5C+also+considered.%7D%7D%7D%7D.+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n\nFurthermore, if , then with high probability the learning algorithm should run5 in time .\n\n\n\nThis framework is also often referred to as testable learning (for reasons explained in Section 2.2).

This research direction was initiated in [RV ’23] which mainly considered linear classifiers under the Gaussian distribution, and was subsequently extended to many more hypothesis classes and distributions  [GKK ’23, DKKLZ ’23, GKSV ’23, GKSV ’24, GSSV ’24, DKLZ’24, STW ’24, GKSV ’25]. In this blog post, we will survey this research direction and explore some of the techniques used to design such algorithms.\n\n2. How to Modify Framework 2 Algorithms to Work in Framework 3.\n\nIn this section we will discuss a general recipe for converting Framework 2 algorithms into Framework 3 by augmenting them with an appropriate tester. As a case study, we will focus on one of the most widely-studied Framework 2 algorithms: the Low-Degree Algorithm. We will see how it can be upgraded into Framework 3 using the Moment-Matching Tester. Later, in Section 3, we will see how a similar recipe can be used for other algorithms as well.\n\n2.1 What is an Example of Framework 2 Algorithm? The Low-Degree Algorithm.\n\nWe begin by examining the following Framework 2 algorithm.\n\n\n\nDegree-k Low-Degree Algorithm [KKMS ’08]:\n\nGiven: access to independent Gaussian examples labeled by unknown function  and a parameter .\n\nOutput: hypothesis .\n\n\n   { Gaussian examples labeled by function }.\n  \n    Compute\n\n    \n      \n        \n          ![\\displaystyle p^{*}\\leftarrow\\underset{\\boldsymbol{\\text{degree}}-k\\text{ polynomial }p}{\\text{argmin}}\\left[\\mathbb{E}{(x{i},f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x_{i}))\\sim S}\n          p(x_{i})-f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x_{i})\n          \\right] ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+p%5E%7B%2A%7D%5Cleftarrow%5Cunderset%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Ctext%7Bdegree%7D%7D-k%5Ctext%7B+polynomial+%7Dp%7D%7B%5Ctext%7Bargmin%7D%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7B%28x_%7Bi%7D%2Cf_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x_%7Bi%7D%29%29%5Csim+S%7D%7Cp%28x_%7Bi%7D%29-f_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x_%7Bi%7D%29%7C%5Cright%5D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n        \n      \n    \n\n    by solving a linear program.\n  \n  Output hypothesis  mapping  in  to .\n\n\n\n\nIt can be shown [KKMS ’08, DGJSV ’10] that, for , the resulting classifier  will achieve prediction error ![{\\text{O(\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\text{Linear Classifiers}}}})+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BO%28%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BLinear+Classifiers%7D%7D%7D%7D%29%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002). Furthermore, with a slightly more sophisticated version of step 3, the prediction error improves to ![{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\text{Linear Classifiers}}}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BLinear+Classifiers%7D%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) [KKMS ’08, DGJSV ’10]. The run-time is .\n\nThis approach also yields a classifier  with error ![{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}}}}}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) for many other hypothesis classes , such as ANDs of linear classifiers or indicators of convex sets in  [KOS ’08]. The same approach can even be used when the class  is constant-depth circuits and the distribution  is uniform over binary bit-strings [KKMS ’08]. To achieve all these results, we only need to run the algorithm above with a larger value of the degree parameter . The run-time  will increase, but as long as we insist on error bound of ![{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) in Framework 2, this approach is known to be optimal for many hypothesis classes  [DFTWW’15, DKZ ’20, GGK ’20, DKPZ ’21, DKR ’23].

From now on, we will make a tacit assumption that this improved version of step 3 is used.)\n\n2.2 Converting the Low-Degree Algorithm into Framework 3 via the Moment-Matching Test.\n\nFor a wide range of concept classes , you can get Framework 3 algorithms by combining the Low-Degree Algorithm with a suitable tester . Here is a general recipe to extend Framework 2 algorithms so they run in Framework 3:\n\n\n  Run6 an algorithm  for class  in Framework 2 to get a classifier \n  Run some algorithm , which we will call the tester, that accesses  and outputs Accept or Reject.\n  If  accepts, then return the classifier  from step (1).\n  If  rejects, then run a (potentially very slow) algorithm  for class  in Framework 1. (See Section 1.3 for more about those)\n\n\nLet us compare Framework 2 and Framework 3, to see what specifications the tester  needs to meet to ensure that the procedure above satisfies Framework 3. We see that it would suffice if algorithm  accepted whenever  and rejected whenever . Unfortunately, for example when  is the Gaussian distribution, there is provably no tester  that can distinguish if  or .\n\nHowever, we can get away with less stringent requirements for  and still achieve our goal:\n\n\n  Completeness: whenever , the tester  accepts with high probability.\n  \n    Soundness: For all distributions , either the tester  will with high probability reject , or  is such that the algorithm  will with high probability give a hypothesis  satisfying the -optimality guarantee\n\n    ![\\displaystyle \\overbrace{\\Pr_{x\\sim D_{\\text{Examples}}}[h(x)\\neq f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x)]}^{\\text{Prediction error of \\ensuremath{h}.}}\\leq\\overbrace{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}}^{\\text{Optimal prediction error in \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}.}}}+\\varepsilon. ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Coverbrace%7B%5CPr%7Bx%5Csim+D_%7B%5Ctext%7BExamples%7D%7D%7D%5Bh%28x%29%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x%29%5D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BPrediction+error+of+%5Censuremath%7Bh%7D.%7D%7D%5Cleq%5Coverbrace%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BOptimal+prediction+error+in+%5Censuremath%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D.%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n  \n  Fast Run Time: the tester  runs in time at most .\n\n\nThe point of the Soundness condition is to permit the algorithm  to accept a distribution  even if  but  is still “good enough” for the algorithm .\n\nLet us come back to using the recipe above, taking  to be the Low-Degree Algorithm. The recipe above can be executed using the following algorithm7 as the tester :\n\n\n\nDegree- Moment-Matching Tester [RV ’23, GKK ’23]:\n\n\n  Given: access to independent examples from , a reference distribution , parameter .\n  Output: Accept or Reject.\n\n\n\n   { examples from }.\n  For all monomials  of total degree at most :\n    \n      If , output Reject and terminate. \n(Note: For many distributions  of interest, such as Gaussian distribution, the quantity  can be computed directly. One can also draw samples from  and use them to estimate .)\n    \n  \n  If this step is reached, output Accept.\n\n\n\n\nSince in  dimensions there are at most  monomials of degree , the Moment-Matching Tester above runs in time .\n\nOverall, using the recipe above to combine the degree- Low-Degree Algorithm with the degree- Moment-Matching Tester, yields Framework 3 algorithms for many concept classes—including linear classifiers, ANDs of linear classifiers, and constant-depth circuits. As a concrete example, when  is the class of linear classifiers, the resulting algorithm in Framework 3 has a run-time bound  of . This run-time matches best algorithm of in Framework 2 (believed to be optimal).\n\nThe proof of correctness for these algorithms in Framework 3 is far from automatic. As explained in Section 2.3, the notion of sandwiching polynomials from the field of pseudorandomness turns out to be very important for the proof of correctness [GKK ’23].\n\nRemark: many papers referenced here phrase their main result as a tester  that satisfies the three aforementioned conditions of completeness, soundness and fast run-time (together with a Framework 2 algorithm ). Note that, as described above and also noted in [RV ’23], having such a tester gives8 an algorithm in Framework 3 (in fact it is equivalent to having an algorithm in Framework 3 [RV ’23]).\n\n2.3 Analysis of the Moment-Matching Tester through Sandwiching Polynomials.\n\nSoon, we will discuss more Framework 3 algorithms, but let us first discuss the proof of correctness for the Moment-Matching Tester. Recall that it needs to satisfy three conditions: Completeness, Soundness and Fast Run Time. Among these three, the Soundness condition is the most challenging one to prove. [GKK ’23] give a principled way of doing this, which we will briefly sketch now. A key step is to show that every function  in the class  has -sandwiching polynomials of degree  under , i.e. a pair of polynomials  and  satisfying:\n\n\n  Sandwiching: for every point , we have .\n  -Closeness: we have .\n\n\nFor example, linear classifiers have -sandwiching polynomials of degree  under the Gaussian distribution [DGJSV ’10]. This notion was first studied in the field of pseudorandomness, because the existence of sandwiching polynomials for  can be leveraged to approximate the expectation  while only making deterministic queries to .\n\nIt is shown in [GKK ’23] that whenever such a pair of polynomials exists for every  in the hypothesis class , then for the Moment-Matching Tester, the Soundness condition holds. Let us briefly sketch the argument, denoting by  the function in  with the smallest prediction error ![{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002). By assumption, there is a pair of sandwiching polynomials  and  for .\n\nIf the distribution  is such that the Moment-Matching Tester is likely to pass, then for every monomial  of degree at most  we have .

Going Beyond Low-Degree Algorithm.\n\nTo recap: in Framework 2, the Low-Degree Algorithm works for many hypothesis classes , giving a classifier  with error ![{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002). In Framework 3, this algorithm can be used together with the Moment-Matching Tester to get computationally efficient algorithms. However, this approach has a number of limitations:\n\n\n  Run-time for the Low-Degree Algorithm tends to be exponential in . For example, to get error ![{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\text{Linear Classifiers}}}}+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BLinear+Classifiers%7D%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002), the Low-Degree Algorithms needs to run in time .\n  The algorithms are improper, which means the hypothesis  they give is not itself in the class . To be concrete, compare the two following two tasks:\n    \n      (a) We get a labeled data-set , and we want to fit approximately the best linear classifier to .\n      (b) We get a labeled data set , and we want to fit a classifier to  of the form  where  is some polynomial, this classifier should approximately be as good as the best linear classifier on  .\nThe Low-Degree Algorithm is solving task (b) not task (a). However, most people would agree that task (a) is far more natural.* The Moment-Matching Tester is guaranteed to accept when the distribution  equals to a specific distribution , but still might reject when  is very similar to . Formally, one can construct a distribution  that will be rejected by the degree- Moment-Matching Tester, even though .\n    \n  \n\n\nWe will now discuss subsequent work that focuses on removing these limitations.\n\n3.1 The Matter of Efficiency: Polynomial-Time Algorithms in Framework 3.\n\n3.1.1 Learning Beyond Low-Degree Algorithm.\n\nIn contrast with the Low-Degree Algorithm, some algorithms in Framework 2 are tailor-made for specific classes  and have run-times , at the price of looser error guarantees such as ![{O(\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}})+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%29%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) or ![{\\widetilde{O}(\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}})+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%29%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002).

Also, unlike the Low-Degree Algorithm, these algorithms are proper, i.e. the hypothesis  they produce is itself a linear classifier, rather than a complicated function of the form .\n\nHowever, all these algorithms inherently operate in Framework 2 rather than Framework 3, relying on the Gaussianity assumption not only for their run-time but also for their accuracy guarantee. For example, we can see that all three aforementioned steps — (a), (b) and (c) — in the accuracy analysis of the Averaging Algorithm use Gaussianity in crucial ways.\n\n3.1.2 Modified Moment-Matching Tester.\n\nCan we again use the recipe from Section 2.2 and the Moment-Matching Tester to get a -time algorithm in Framework 3 based on the Averaging Algorithm? Conceptually, the Moment-Matching Tester checks that the distribution  is indistinguishable from  by low-degree monomials. It is therefore unsurprising that this tester works well with the Low-Degree Algorithm, as this algorithm is based on finding the best-fitting polynomial. By the same token, one would not expect the Moment-Matching Tester to work well with tailor-made algorithms such as the Averaging Algorithm, as these algorithms do not use polynomials in any way.\n\nSurprisingly, a modified version of the Moment-Matching Tester can nevertheless be used in this way. First, we run one of these algorithms and obtain a hypothesis . As in Section 2.2, we need to decide whether to output the classifier  or to run a slow Framework 1 Algorithm. This is again done by running a tester , but here the tester also uses the vector  obtained prior to running the tester:\n\n\n\nStrip Tester [DKKLZ ’23, GKSV ’23, GKSV ’24]:\n\n\n  Given: access to independent examples from , a reference distribution , unit vector  in .\n  Output: Accept or Reject.\n\n\n\n   { independent examples from }.\n  For all monomials  of total degree at most  and integers :\n    \n      \n        Define\n\n        ![\\displaystyle \\mathbf{1}{w\\cdot x\\in[i\\varepsilon,(i+1)\\varepsilon]}=\\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }w\\cdot x\\in[i\\varepsilon,(i+1)\\varepsilon]\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D%7Bw%5Ccdot+x%5Cin%5Bi%5Cvarepsilon%2C%28i%2B1%29%5Cvarepsilon%5D%7D%3D%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+1+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7Dw%5Ccdot+x%5Cin%5Bi%5Cvarepsilon%2C%28i%2B1%29%5Cvarepsilon%5D%5C%5C+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise.%7D+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n      \n      \n        If ![{\\lvert\\mathbb{E}{x\\sim S}[m(x)\\mathbf{1}{w\\cdot x\\in[i\\varepsilon,(i+1)\\varepsilon]}]-\\mathbb{E}{x\\sim D{\\text{Assumption}}}[m(x)\\mathbf{1}{w\\cdot x\\in[i\\varepsilon,(i+1)\\varepsilon]}]\\rvert&gt;\\left(\\varepsilon/d\\right)^{O(1)}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clvert%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7Bx%5Csim+S%7D%5Bm%28x%29%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D_%7Bw%5Ccdot+x%5Cin%5Bi%5Cvarepsilon%2C%28i%2B1%29%5Cvarepsilon%5D%7D%5D-%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bx%5Csim+D_%7B%5Ctext%7BAssumption%7D%7D%7D%5Bm%28x%29%5Cmathbf%7B1%7D_%7Bw%5Ccdot+x%5Cin%5Bi%5Cvarepsilon%2C%28i%2B1%29%5Cvarepsilon%5D%7D%5D%5Crvert%3E%5Cleft%28%5Cvarepsilon%2Fd%5Cright%29%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002), output Reject and terminate.\n      \n    \n  \n  If this step is reached, output Accept.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, the algorithm above breaks the -dimensional space into strips along the vector  and runs the degree- moment tester for each of the strips.\n\nCombining this Strip Tester with the Framework 2 algorithm of [DKTZ ’20], yields an algorithm in Framework 3 with prediction error ![{O(\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}})+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%29%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) and run-time  [DKKLZ ’23, GKSV ’23, GKSV ’24], where  is the class of origin-centered linear classifiers.\n\nMoreover, like the Averaging Algorithm, this algorithm is proper, i.e. the hypothesis  is itself a linear classifier. This addresses the second limitation of the Low Degree Algorithm we pointed out earlier.\n\n3.2 Assumption-Tolerance and the Spectral Tester.\n\nFinally, we briefly discuss some recent work on addressing the third limitation of the Moment-Matching Tester described in the beginning of Section 3. To recap, the limitation is that the Moment-Matching Tester might reject distributions that are very close to the distribution  but not exactly equal to it. To address this, the paper considers the following11 more stringent version of Framework 3:\n\n\n\nFramework 4 [Tolerant Testable Framework] For any  and  the learning algorithm should with high probability output a classifier  with\n\n![\\displaystyle \\overbrace{\\Pr_{x\\sim D_{\\text{Examples}}}[h(x)\\neq f_{\\text{noisy labels}}(x)]}^{\\text{Prediction error of \\ensuremath{h}.}}\\leq\\underbrace{\\overbrace{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}}^{\\text{Optimal prediction error in \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{C}.}}}+\\varepsilon}{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{Weaker guarantees such as O(\\ensuremath{\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}}})+\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon\\ }also considered.}}}}. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Coverbrace%7B%5CPr%7Bx%5Csim+D_%7B%5Ctext%7BExamples%7D%7D%7D%5Bh%28x%29%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Ctext%7Bnoisy+labels%7D%7D%28x%29%5D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BPrediction+error+of+%5Censuremath%7Bh%7D.%7D%7D%5Cleq%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Coverbrace%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BOptimal+prediction+error+in+%5Censuremath%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D.%7D%7D%7D%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7B%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7BWeaker+guarantees+such+as+O%28%5Censuremath%7B%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%7D%29%2B%5Censuremath%7B%5Cvarepsilon%5C+%7Dalso+considered.%7D%7D%7D%7D.+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%282%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002)\n\nFurthermore, for some absolute constant , if , then with high probability the learning algorithm should run in time .\n\n\n\nIn [GSSV ’24], a general methodology is developed for designing algorithms in this more general framework. For example, when  is the Gaussian distribution and  is the class of linear classifiers, a run-time of  is achieved, matching the best algorithms in Frameworks 2 and 3.\n\nIn brief, one of the key insights is that the degree- Moment-Matching tester can often be replaced by what is called the degree- Spectral Tester. Given a data-set , this tester checks that\n\n\n\nThe second insight is that the degree- Spectral Tester can be implemented in time  using an eigenvalue computation. The final insight12 is that when  one can remove  fraction of elements from  and have it pass the Spectral Tester. [GSSV ’24] designs an algorithm that efficiently finds which  fraction of elements needs to be removed from  to achieve this.\n\n4. Other recent work.\n\nThis blog post focused on side-stepping the intractability of Framework 1 via making assumptions on the distribution  and not making any assumptions on the labeling function . Yet, improved algorithms are possible when the labeling function  is also assumed to be well-behaved. For example, the Random Classification Noise assumption essentially presupposes that  is formed by taking a hypothesis  in the class  and flipping each function value with some probability . The work of [GKSV ’25] gives algorithms for which (like in Framework 3) the failure of the Random Classification Noise assumptions can affect only the run-time rather than the accuracy guarantee. [GKSV ’25] also designs such algorithms for the Massart Noise assumption that is far more general than the Random Classification Noise assumption.\n\nThe work of [STW ’24] shows how to use the Low-Degree Algorithm and the Moment-Matching Tester to get algorithms in Framework 3 for the challenging hypothesis class of polynomial threshold functions.\n\nThe work of [GKSV ’23] extends Framework 3 to families of distributions. Rather than being required to run in time  only when  for a specific distribution , the algorithms are required to run in time  when  belongs to an entire family of distributions ![{\\mathcal{D}{\\text{Assumption}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BAssumption%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002). Designing such algorithms turns out to be intimately connected with the field of Sum-of-Squares relaxations [KS17].\n\n[KKV24, GSSV’24, CKKSV’24, KSV’24] build on the approaches described here to test distribution shift, i.e. to test that the unlabeled data found during deployment of a classifier  comes from the same distribution as the training data. Similar to the test in Section 2.2, the test is required to either guarantee that  has a good prediction accuracy on this new dataset, or to detect that the new dataset came from a data distribution that differs from the distribution used during training.\n\n5.

What about algorithms with run-times  or  when  is fixed to be a small constant (say )?\n\n\n\nTo the best of our understanding, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, the NP-hardness results of [GR’06, FGKP’06] imply that no -time algorithm exists for this problem for a proper learning algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that itself outputs a linear classifier. However, when general improper algorithms are considered (i.e. algorithms with no restrictions on what classifier they can produce), no such hardness result is known.\n\nThe following is an open question in Framework 2:\n\n\n\nOpen problem 2: Is there an algorithm in Framework 2 with accuracy ![{O(\\text{opt}{\\mathcal{C}})+\\varepsilon}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Ctext%7Bopt%7D%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%29%2B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002) and run-time bound , when  is the class of linear classifiers and  is the uniform distribution over ?

      "title": "Windows on Theory: AI Safety Course Intro Blog",
      "url": "/cstheoryrss/2025/07/21/windows-on-theory-ai-safety-course-intro-blog/",
      "content": "I am teaching CS 2881: AI Safety this fall at Harvard. This blog is primarily aimed at students at Harvard or MIT (where we have a cross-registering agreement) who are considering taking the course. However, it may be of interest to others as well. For more of my thoughts on AI safety, see the blogs Six Thoughts on AI safety and Machines of Faithful Obedience.\n\nIMPORTANT: At the end of this blog is Homework Zero. If you are a Harvard or MIT student that is interested in taking the course, then you will need to submit this homework to apply for a seat. See details below.\n\nWhy AI Safety?\n\nIf you are considering taking this course, you are probably aware that there is a significant chance that AI will cause profound changes to our world over the next years and decades. However, there is significant disagreement about the magnitude of these changes, as well as whether they will be positive or negative.\n\nHere is an illustrative plot of various potential scenarios for the next decade that people had predicted. (The GDP and life expectancy numbers are just illustrative- these were not explicitly predicted by the cited people, but are o3’s interpretations of the scenarios, see appendix below.)\n\n\n\nAs the saying goes, predictions are hard, especially about the future. Even the most AI-hawkish predictors sometimes underestimate its advances. For example, Paul Christiano has predicted a less than 8% chance of AI achieving IMO gold performance by 2025. (You can decide what this means for interpreting his predictions of a 15% chance for a Dyson Sphere by 2030 and 40% by 2040.)\n\nAnything between utopia and catastrophe has been predicted. Clearly, we would like the impact of AI in 2035 to be up and to the right in this plot. This course will focus on what we know about the technical aspects of how we can get there,  and particularly on avoiding the bottom left quadrant.\n\nWe will have a particular focus on two aspects: measurement and scale.\n\nThere is a famous saying, “You can’t improve what you don’t measure.” In AI, we often encounter the converse as well; time and again, we have found that once we can measure an objective, we can also improve upon it. Alignment and safety often make the measurement task more complex: the phenomena we deal with could involve worst-case behavior, complex interactions of multiple components (both human and AI), behaviors such as “cheating” that are not always easy to define. Hence, measurements and evaluations will play a significant part in this course.\n\nThe other component is scale. The fundamental property of current AI systems is that they are not static – they constantly grow in the resources they use (data, compute), their capabilities, and their scope of implementation and influence. For every type of safety concern, we need to ask ourselves, is this a problem that would get better or worse with scale. Similarly, for every safety intervention we need to ask whether this is a method that would work better or worse with scale.\n\nTopics\n\nA list of questions that we may* consider in this course includes:\n\n\n  What are the potential risks and benefits of AI?\n  What potential capabilities of AI could lead to catastrophic risks? For which ones do we think that AI can also be used to help defend against the risk?\n  What lessons can we learn from other fields, including aviation and transportation safety, computer security, and others.\n  Is there a tension between capabilities and safety? Which current safety methods become better as capabilities improve, and which ones become worse?\n  How can we obtain “leading indicators” to measure potential for catastrophic risk before it happens?\n  What aspects of AI training process can lead to increased risk? This includes phenomena such as reward hacking, scheming, alignment faking, etc..\n  When AI behaves in “bad” ways, can we always trace it back to either their dataset or the objectives they trained on?\n  How do we even define precisely notions such as “scheming”, “sandbagging”, “reward hacking”, “unfaithfulness”?\n  What is the goal for alignment – AI following instructions by humans? AI having good values? Something else?\n  What are the ways to evaluate AIs for safety?\n  Can we make AI models robust to adversaries who can modify their inputs? Are there fundamental limitations to this? Does making models adversarially robust requires making them less capable on non-adversarial inputs?\n  What are the unique safety aspects that arise when AI is being used to build future versions of itself?\n  What are ways to understand the reasoning of why models provide certain outputs – white box, black box, and intermediate (e.g., access to privileged outputs such as “chain of thought”) methods? Are there ways that only white-box methods can achieve and not black-box ones?\n  What is the role of “model organisms” – specific examples designed to exhibit specific behavior.\n  How will AI impact individual freedoms?  mass surveillance, etc..\n  How will AI impact warfare?  international stability.\n  How can we do “unlearning” for either safety or privacy.\n  As AI tools become more capable, how does this translate into an increase in need for model weight security?\n  What are prompt injection attacks and how can we defend against them.\n\n\n* We will likely not get to many of those, and we will see what we cover as we go along.\n\nHomework Zero\n\nIn order to maintain the ability for effective discussion, as well as due to compute limitations, we will cap the number of students in the course. If you are a Harvard or MIT student and are interested in the course, you will need to submit the following “homework zero” to apply to join. Submitting homework zero does not guarantee you a place in the course, but hopefully, you will find doing it interesting and rewarding regardless.  You will be reimbursed up to $40 for compute expenses in doing this project.\n\nThe homework will be to replicate a variant of the “emergent misalignment” paper by Betley et al., specifically following the work of Turner et al.\n\nIf you are a Harvard or MIT student that. have filled out the course interest form then you will get an invite to the repository with code and instructions for submissions.. Please sign up to it with the same email you use for registering to courses (your Harvard key email address). The homework will be due on 11:59pm eastern Monday August 4 2025.\n\n\n\nAppendix: o3’s summary of predictions\n\nFollowing is o3’s summary of AI forecasters predictions. (I’ve used multiple prompts/conversations to get it in the right format, which makes it less convenient to share the conversation.

      "content": "Authors: Ahammed Ullah, S. M. Ferdous, Alex Pothen\n\nWe introduce the poly-streaming model, a generalization of streaming models\nof computation in which $k$ processors process $k$ data streams containing a\ntotal of $N$ items. The algorithm is allowed $O\\left(f(k)\\cdot M_1\\right)$\nspace, where $M_1$ is either $o\\left(N\\right)$ or the space bound for a\nsequential streaming algorithm. Processors may communicate as needed.\nAlgorithms are assessed by the number of passes, per-item processing time,\ntotal runtime, space usage, communication cost, and solution quality.\nWe design a single-pass algorithm in this model for approximating the maximum\nweight matching (MWM) problem. Given $k$ edge streams and a parameter\n$\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the algorithm computes a\n$\\left(2+\\epsilon\\right)$-approximate MWM. We analyze its performance in a\nshared-memory parallel setting: for any constant $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, it runs in\ntime $\\widetilde{O}\\left(L_{\\max}+n\\right)$, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices and $L_{\\max}$ is the maximum stream length. It supports\n$O\\left(1\\right)$ per-edge processing time using $\\widetilde{O}\\left(k\\cdot\nn\\right)$ space. We further generalize the design to hierarchical\narchitectures, in which $k$ processors are partitioned into $r$ groups, each\nwith its own shared local memory. The total intergroup communication is\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(r \\cdot n\\right)$ bits, while all other performance\nguarantees are preserved.\nWe evaluate the algorithm on a shared-memory system using graphs with\ntrillions of edges. It achieves substantial speedups as $k$ increases and\nproduces matchings with weights significantly exceeding the theoretical\nguarantee. On our largest test graph, it reduces runtime by nearly two orders\nof magnitude and memory usage by five orders of magnitude compared to an\noffline algorithm.\n\nRead original post\n"

While this assumption makes\nthe problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it\nremains quite challenging.

We consider two natural sparsity objectives: minimizing the maximum\nout-degree and minimizing the total size.\nWe first show a strong negative result: the slow-preprocessing version of\nDiskANN (analyzed in [IX23] for low-doubling metrics) can yield solutions whose\nsparsity is $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n)$ times larger than optimal, even on\nEuclidean instances. We then show a tight approximation-preserving equivalence\nbetween the Sparsest Navigable Graph problem and the classic Set Cover problem,\nobtaining an $O(n^3)$-time $(\\ln n + 1)$-approximation algorithm, as well as\nestablishing NP-hardness of achieving an $o(\\ln n)$-approximation. Building on\nthis equivalence, we develop faster $O(\\ln n)$-approximation algorithms. The\nfirst runs in $\\widetilde{O}(n \\cdot \\mathrm{OPT})$ time and is thus much\nfaster when the optimal solution is sparse. The second, based on fast matrix\nmultiplication, is a bicriteria algorithm that computes an $O(\\ln\nn)$-approximation to the sparsest $2\\alpha$-navigable graph, running in\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{\\omega})$ time.\nFinally, we complement our upper bounds with a query complexity lower bound,\nshowing that any $o(n)$-approximation requires examining $\\Omega(n^2)$\ndistances.

Naive centralized algorithms\nrun BFS/DFS from each source in $O(m \\cdot n^{\\sigma})$ time or compute $G$’s\ntransitive closure in $\\hat O(n^{\\omega})$ time, where $\\omega \\le\n2.371552\\ldots$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Thus, the best known\nbound is $\\hat O(n^{\\min { 2 + \\sigma, \\omega}})$. Leveraging shortcut\nconstructions by Kogan and Parter [SODA 2022, ICALP 2022], we develop a\ncentralized algorithm with running time $\\hat O(n^{1 + \\frac{2}{3}\n\\omega(\\sigma)})$, where $\\omega(\\sigma)$ is the rectangular matrix\nmultiplication exponent. Using current estimates on $\\omega(\\sigma)$, our\nexponent improves upon $\\min {2 + \\sigma, \\omega }$ for $\\tilde \\sigma \\leq\n\\sigma \\leq 0.53$, where $1/3 &lt; \\tilde \\sigma &lt; 0.3336$ is a universal\nconstant.\nIn a classical result, Cohen [Journal of Algorithms, 1996] devised parallel\nalgorithms for $S \\times V$ reachability on graphs admitting balanced recursive\nseparators of size $n^{\\rho}$ for $\\rho &lt; 1$, requiring polylogarithmic time\nand work $n^{\\max {\\omega \\rho, 2\\rho + \\sigma } + o(1)}$. We significantly\nimprove, extend, and generalize Cohen’s result. First, our parallel algorithm\nfor graphs with small recursive separators has lower work complexity than\nCohen’s in boraod paramater ranges. Second, we generalize our algorithm to\ngraphs of treewidth at most $n^{\\rho}$ ($\\rho &lt; 1$) and provide a centralized\nalgorithm that outperforms existing bounds for $S \\times V$ reachability on\nsuch graphs. We also do this for some other graph familes with small\nseparators. Finally, we extend these results to $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximate\ndistance computation.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Vincent Cohen-Addad, Fabian Kuhn, Zahra Parsaeian\n\nIn this paper, we present an efficient massively parallel approximation\nalgorithm for the $k$-means problem. Specifically, we provide an MPC algorithm\nthat computes a constant-factor approximation to an arbitrary $k$-means\ninstance in $O(\\log\\log n \\cdot \\log\\log\\log n)$ rounds. The algorithm uses\n$O(n^\\sigma)$ bits of memory per machine, where $\\sigma &gt; 0$ is a constant that\ncan be made arbitrarily small. The global memory usage is\n$O(n^{1+\\varepsilon})$ bits for an arbitrarily small constant $\\varepsilon &gt;\n0$, and is thus only slightly superlinear. Recently, Czumaj, Gao, Jiang,\nKrauthgamer, and Vesel'{y} showed that a constant-factor bicriteria\napproximation can be computed in $O(1)$ rounds in the MPC model. However, our\nalgorithm is the first constant-factor approximation for the general $k$-means\nproblem that runs in $o(\\log n)$ rounds in the MPC model.\nOur approach builds upon the foundational framework of Jain and Vazirani. The\ncore component of our algorithm is a constant-factor approximation for the\nrelated facility location problem. While such an approximation was already\nachieved in constant time in the work of Czumaj et al.\\ mentioned above, our\nversion additionally satisfies the so-called Lagrangian Multiplier Preserving\n(LMP) property. This property enables the transformation of a facility location\napproximation into a comparably good $k$-means approximation.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Shantanav Chakraborty, Soonwon Choi, Soumik Ghosh, Tudor Giurgică-Tiron\n\nDeep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from\nquantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum\nthermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement.\nHere, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest\npossible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit\ndynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth\nthat are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally\nbounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies\nof the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the\nstate – this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum\npseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms,\nthese states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these\nproperties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of\ncomputational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from\nstructured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of\nfrom highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing\nthese states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum\ncomputers.

      "url": "/cstheoryrss/2025/07/20/david-eppstein-twenty-years-of-blogging/",
      "content": "I made my first post to this blog twenty years ago, on July 20, 2005.\n\nInitially, it was on LiveJournal, and consisted of a mix of longer-form postings with the sort of brief commentary on web links that, today, I would post as a Mastodon toot. The (lack of) focus has always been roughly the same: technical and arty stuff that interests me, research notes too small or preliminary to publish as a proper paper, open problems, announcements of new publications, conference reports, personal updates, and academic and technical politics. I started cross-posting to Google+ in 2011, stopped again soon after that over a new policy forbidding pseudonymous users, and returned in 2014 after this policy was rescinded. At that point I moved the brief links to Google+, shifting to a format where the blog itself contained only the longer posts and roundups of the links.\n\nLiveJournal was sold to a Russian company in 2007, and for many years after that it operated much as it had before, but gradually became more annoying about showing ads even to readers of my (paid and supposedly ad-free) account. In 2017 they imposed new terms of service with Russian legal restrictions (in particular, against LBGTQ+ advocacy) that I found unacceptable and refused to sign. Instead, I deleted my account and moved to GitHub Pages, including my old posts, almost all of which I had backed up before that became impossible. Under GitHub, everything is in a git repository that I keep local copies of, so it should be much easier to move again should I need to. The old posts were in html format and the posts after the move are in markdown format but fortunately it all works with the mix of formats. Later I slowly went through the old posts cleaning up some dubious markup, migrating image files to GitHub, and using vector graphic files when I still had them; that process is still not entirely complete.\n\nUsing GitHub meant static content and no discussion threads, and I was already using Google+ for the shorter link posts, so I started using it to host discussion links for my posts as well. By the time Google cancelled Google+ in 2019, my posts included many links to Google+, most of which I was able to replace with copies on archive.org. Needing a new host for short posts and discussion links, I chose Mastodon and mathstodon.xyz. For once, my habit of choosing a technically better solution over a more popular solution paid off: I have never used Twitter, so I haven’t had to move again after recent events. And here I am now.\n\nAnyway, I thought at this anniversary it would be appropriate to make a roundup of twenty of my old posts that I found particularly memorable and maybe worth revisiting. Here they are, in chronological order:\n\n\n  Updated Python library: Repetitivity, Sudoku, July 20, 2005. My first post. It’s more telegraphic than I would write now, but I think otherwise it stands up well. It describes an open-source command-line Sudoku solver that I wrote, aimed at mimicking human deduction rather than doing what would be much easier for a computer, backtracking search, and an efficient algorithm for one of its deduction rules, based on finding the edges of a bipartite graph that cannot take part in a perfect matching.\n  Periodic coloring of tilings, September 11, 2006. For any periodic tiling of the plane (or, if you prefer, a periodic planar graph), you can 4-color the tiles or the vertices, by a combination of the 4-color theorem for finite graphs and the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem on coloring infinite graphs. But the coloring might not itself be periodic. If you ask for a periodic coloring with the same period as the original tiling, then it’s the same as coloring a graph on the torus and you might need six colors. But I still don’t know how many colors you need if you require periodicity but allow a bigger fundamental region.\n  The range-restricted Hamming problem, March 18, 2007. How to quickly solve a problem from ancient Mesopotamia: listing all ({2,3,5})-smooth numbers in the range ([60^k,60^{k+1}]).

Pretentious title aside, this is on choosing among multiple incompatible definitions for pseudolines, with more in a follow-up post. I think it continues to be relevant: as of this posting the Wikipedia pseudoline article still fails to adequately define a single pseudoline: it uses a definition that has the intended meaning only for arrangements of more than one pseudoline.\n  The many faces of the Nauru graph, December 12, 2007. This roundup of different drawing styles for the 24-vertex cubic symmetric graph gave it a name which has since caught on: Google Scholar now lists 80 publications containing the “Nauru graph” phrase. Follow-ups: a 3d ray-trace of its genus-four symmetric embedding and another drawing with lots of unnecessary crossings.\n  Parts assembly and the burr puzzle antimatroid, December 2, 2008. In how many orders can you take apart a six-piece burr puzzle? This is not the first post I made about antimatroids, but I think it is the first to make a point I have repeated multiple times since then. Despite the scary name, antimatroids formalize a simple and intuitive concept, that you are doing some things one at a time and that once a thing becomes available for you to do it stays available until you do it. In this case, the things you are doing are removing pieces from the puzzle. Later posts applied the same idea to rhyme schemes, course prerequisites, deductions in logic puzzles, quadtree mesh generation, and introductory computer programming.\n  Flat equilateral tori?, February 3, 2009. An easy-to-state unsolved problem: can you make a torus out of equilateral triangles meeting six to a vertex? Usually I draw vector graphics illustrations for my geometry posts but for this one I used photographs of snap-together plastic triangles.\n  Visualizing BFS as a spiral, May 16, 2009. When applied to the Calkin–Wilf tree this produces a sequence containing all positive rational numbers exactly once, with a simple formula for determining each successive number from the previous one that behaves the same everywhere in the spiral, regardless of jumps in level in the breadth-first search tree.\n  A mathematical model of conference acceptance rates, July 18, 2011. If program committees base their decisions on some combination of strength, fashion, and random factors, but the outcome you want is to accept all of the strongest papers, then you’re probably going to need higher acceptance rates and more acceptances of weaker papers than you might expect. But the “mathematical model” here is very unsophisticated and can probably be made much more realistic.\n  Stack-based graph traversal ≠ depth first search, December 17, 2013. A surprisingly common mistake in algorithm texts. It is possible to start with a form of BFS, replace the queue by a stack, and get DFS, but you have to be careful or you’ll get something else instead. See also xkcd on depth and breadth.\n  MathML considered harmful, August 4, 2015. Or, how the pursuit of an unrealistic ideal has harmed and continues to harm the legibility and editability of mathematical formulas on Wikipedia.\n  The shape of the Kresge Auditorium, April 30, 2016. A study of the geometry of MIT’s Kresge Auditorium, a curved triangle formed by projecting onto the plane an eighth of a sphere, comparing it with the Reuleaux triangle, a similar-looking but different curved triangle. This was the first of what became a series of posts on curved triangles that other people had called Reuleaux triangles, but that were not actually Reuleaux triangles.

I recently joined the board of the Computational Geometry Society, one of whose main roles is to provide a legal framework to keep proven predators away from our conferences. This was one of multiple incidents (the others less public) convincing me that this role is still necessary and important.\n  One thousand women of STEM!, September 22, 2019. Since I started in 2005, I’ve spent a lot of time editing Wikipedia. Since 2008, one of the things I have been doing there has been creating biographies of women in STEM. By my rough estimate there were 1000 by this date and by my even rougher estimate it’s likely to be over 3000 by now. If I had to choose who I most want others to know about, it would be the first one listed in this post: Pandrosion of Alexandria, the first female mathematician that we know by name.\n  Gilbert tessellations from a cellular automaton, November 2, 2021. Long ago Stephen Wolfram described a four-way subdivision of the typical behaviors of cellular automata on random initial fields: they can die out, quickly form small stable or periodic structures, stay chaotic, or exhibit complex behaviors. This post points to an intermediate possibility: they can build walls that extend across space until they are blocked by other walls. Similar wall-building behavior was studied by Gilbert in the 1950s as a model of crack formation, and has appeared in some of my computational geometry papers under the heading of “motorcycle graphs”, named for the Tron light-cycle wall-building game.\n  Midsphere facts and fallacies, July 27, 2022. A midsphere is a sphere tangent to all edges of a polyhedron. All polyhedra have a combinatorially equivalent form with a midsphere. But contrary to what multiple sources state, the midsphere does not always touch the midpoints of the edges. It is not true that only the Platonic solids have all three of an insphere, midsphere, and circumsphere. When a polyhedron has all three, they might not be concentric nor even nested. The midsphere might not be the smallest sphere touching all the edges. I don’t know whether (when both exist) the inradius is always smaller than the midradius, or whether the midradius is always smaller than the circumradius.\n  Coloring the plane for generic norms, May 13, 2023. Many of my posts attempt to provide a more-accessible explanation of research from my own papers. This one is similar, but for a paper that is not mine, by Noga Alon, Matija Bucić and Lisa Sauermann on the problem of coloring the unit distance graph of the plane. For Euclidean distances the number of colors you need is 5, 6, or 7, but it remains a big open problem which one. Alon et al prove that for generic convex distance functions, the number of colors is exactly four, but finding a natural strictly-convex distance function for which this is true is another open problem.\n  Random perfection, May 8, 2024. Another Wikipedia editor asked me: how likely is it that a random graph is a perfect graph? It depends on the density of the graph, with two phase transitions between densities for which it is very likely and densities for which it is very unlikely, less sharp than the phase transitions for many other properties.

      "content": "A computational anatomy of intelligence. How faculties interact, architectures diverge, and coherence emerges through self-constructed fictions\n\n\n\n\n  “There is no single path into the forest.” — Yoruba proverb\n\n\nYo-Yo Ma and the Single Note\n\nIt was the winter of 2018 and the NeurIPS conference—one of the world’s premier gatherings on artificial intelligence—had descended on a snow-laced Montreal. Thousands of researchers, engineers, and students crisscrossed the vast convention center, sharing ideas about optimization tricks, new models, and the future of AI. Posters lined the walls of rooms steeped in the aroma of coffee, while outside, the city lay wrapped in cold, crisp silence.\n\nAt one of the marquee panels, a senior executive from a major tech company presented their latest AI music generator—an advanced system trained on thousands of classical works, capable of composing coherent classical music in real time.\n\nThe melodies were elegant and the timing precise.\n\nThen Yo-Yo Ma was invited to respond.\n\nHe didn’t speak. He turned his chair, lifted his cello, and played a single note. Then he played it again. And again. Each time, the same note emerged differently—tentative, bold, grieving, serene. Each time, his breath shifted and his eyes drifted into a different world.\n\nThe AI had captured form. But Yo-Yo Ma, infusing his music with intention and feeling, captured the room.\n\nThat moment didn’t just expose AI’s limitations. It revealed a deeper truth:\n\nIntelligence isn’t precision—it’s relation.\n\nIt does not reside in outputs alone, but in how systems tune themselves to the world: shaped by context, memory, attention, and intent.\n\nIt is a dynamic interplay between perception and action, between internal models and external pressures. It arises wherever systems engage their constraints creatively: whether through mycelial networks, migrating birds, musical phrases, or planetary motion.\n\nIn the previous essay, we traced how intelligence emerges in nature: not as a fixed trait, but as a layered process—optimization in physics, adaptation in evolution, collective sensing in life before neurons.\n\nThis second essay turns inward—from emergence to architecture. If the first asked where intelligence comes from, this one asks: what is it made of?\n\nWe begin by identifying a set of core faculties: sensing, responding, memory, learning, attention, valuation, modeling, and reflection.\n\nThese faculties take many forms. Sensing may be chemical, tactile, social, or symbolic. Memory may be episodic, spatial, or associative. Valuation may be shaped by prediction error, pain, or narrative.\n\nAnd how they are configured—what is emphasized, suppressed, amplified, or ignored—depends not just on design, but on history: evolutionary, developmental, experiential.\n\nFrom these components and their interrelations, intelligence emerges—not as a single thread, but as a weave: recursive, plural, and at times, fictional.\n\nThis part of the essay unfolds in three movements:\n\n\n  Composition: How core faculties combine to produce reasoning, language, and creativity—not through accumulation, but through tension, feedback, and reprogramming.\n  Divergence: Why there is no single blueprint for intelligence. We examine human cognitive diversity to understand the space of architectural variation.\n  Fiction: How intelligent systems—especially human ones—construct internal narratives to manage complexity, maintain coherence, and navigate meaning.\n\n\nThis is not a final theory. It is a trace—a computational lens on intelligence as it curves inward, reshapes itself, and constructs meaning under pressure. For those exploring AI not as an isolated artifact, but as part of a broader landscape of intelligence, this lens may offer new ways to rethink design and augmentation.\n\nAnd like a forest, this inquiry offers no fixed path—only branching terrain shaped by tension, memory, and choice.\n\nRead the full essay by subscribing (for free) toThe Intelligence Loop.\n\nBy nisheethvishnoi\n\nRead original post\n"

      "url": "/cstheoryrss/2025/07/18/francis-bach-revisiting-scaling-laws-via-the-z-transform/",
      "content": "In the last few years, we have seen a surge of empirical and theoretical works about “scaling laws”, whose goals are to characterize the performance of learning methods based on various problem parameters (e.g., number of observations and parameters, or amount of compute). From a theoretical point of view, this marks a renewed interest in asymptotic equivalents—something the machine learning community had mostly moved away from (and, let’s be honest, kind of looked down on) in favor of non-asymptotic bounds. The two types of bounds have their own pros and cons, and I value both of them, but on a personal note, after having spent close to twenty years in proving (sometimes tedious) non-asymptotic results, proving asymptotic results is particularly rewarding, especially when you experience that “aha!” moment where the empirical behavior aligns perfectly with the derived expression (see some examples below).\n\nScaling laws for quadratic optimization require aggregating the effects of all eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix and not considering only the worst one. This was done with Laplace’s method in an earlier post for gradient descent and partially for Nesterov acceleration. This blog post explores similar asymptotic scaling laws and will consider stochastic algorithms, but there is more to it.\n\nI will use a classical tool from applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science: the z-transform (a.k.a. generating function) of a discrete sequence. My goal in this blog post is to present the essentials of the method. For more details, see my recent preprint [1], with lots of potential follow-ups. Note that the z-transform has already been used in the context of stochastic gradient descent for stability analysis [15, 20] and for deriving convergence rates with constant momentum [22].\n\nz-transform method and final value theorem\n\nFrom Abel’s theorem to the finite value theorem. Given a sequence ((b_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}), its z-transform is the function (B) defined for a complex argument (z \\in \\mathbb{C}), as (B(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty b_k z^k) (note the change of convention where (z^{-1}) is replaced by (z)). The behavior of the series defined by ((b_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}) can be characterized by the behavior of (B(z)) for (z) tending to (1) while remaining in ([0,1)). This is the classical Abel’s theorem: when the series defined by ((b_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}) is convergent, then \\(\\sum\\_{k=0}^{+\\infty} b\\_k = \\lim\\_{z \\to 1^-} B(z).\\)\n\nWhen applied to (b_k = a_k\\, – a_{k-1}) for (k \\geqslant 1), with (b_0 = a_0), then we have (\\sum_{\\ell=1}^k b_\\ell = a_k), and (B(z) = (1\\, – z) A(z)) where (A) is the z-transfom of ((a_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}). We then obtain the final value theorem, which states \\(\\lim\\_{z \\to 1^-} \\ ( 1 \\, – z) A(z) = \\lim\\_{k \\to +\\infty} a\\_k.\\)\n\nFrom limits to asymptotic equivalents. In order to obtain equivalents of the sequence ((a_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}) (and not simply its limit), we can use two additional properties:\n\n\n  the z-transform of (((k+1) a_{k+1})_{k \\geqslant 0}) is (A’(z)), leading to \\(\\lim\\_{z \\to 1^-} \\ ( 1 \\, – z) A'(z)= \\lim\\_{k \\to +\\infty} k a\\_k.\\)\n  To treat non-integer powers, we have the following identity, valid for any real (\\nu &gt; 0), \\(\\lim\\_{z \\to 1^-} \\ ( 1 \\,- z)^{\\nu} A(z) = \\Gamma(\\nu) \\cdot \\lim\\_{k \\to +\\infty} k^{1-\\nu} a\\_k,\\) where (\\Gamma) is the Gamma function. A classical example is (a_k = \\frac{1}{k!} \\nu(\\nu+1) \\cdots (\\nu+k-1) = \\frac{ \\Gamma(k+\\nu)}{\\Gamma(\\nu)\\Gamma(k+1)} \\sim \\frac{k^{\\nu-1}}{\\Gamma(\\nu)}), for which (A(z) = (1-z)^{-\\nu}).\n\n\nCombining the last two properties (with an extension to higher-order derivatives), when the two limits exist, we have: \\(\\lim\\_{z \\to 1^-} \\ ( 1 \\, – z)^{\\nu} A^{(\\mu)}(z) = \\Gamma(\\nu)\\cdot \\lim\\_{k \\to +\\infty} k^{1+\\mu-\\nu} a\\_k.\\) Therefore, the z-transform method consists in deriving asymptotics of the z-transform or its derivatives around (z = 1^-). Before showing why this is a simplification, some words on sufficient conditions for the equivalence to hold, through a sequence of so-called “Tauberian” theorems.\n\nTauberian theory. In order to show that limits and asymptotic equivalents exist, several options are available. When only considering real-valued arguments for the z-transforms, various sufficient conditions have been derived from the work of Hardy and Littlewood [2] (the book from Jacob Korevaar [3] is a great source of detailed results). In a nutshell, oscillating sequences such as (a_k = (-1)^k) are the ones where the limits are not equal (or may not exist), and a classical sufficient condition is that there exists a constant (c) such that for all (k \\geqslant 1), (a_k \\, – a_{k-1} \\leqslant c / k^{2+\\mu – \\nu}) (in particular, with (c = 0), being decreasing is a sufficient condition). Alternative frameworks can also be considered using complex analysis, which only depends on property of the z-transform (A(z)) for complex (z) [4, 5].\n\nProperties of the z-transform. What makes the z-transform so versatile is a suite of properties that link modifications of the sequence ((a_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}) to its z-transform (A(z)) (see more details in [1, 6]). The most important ones are:\n\n\n  Shift: If (A(z)) is the z-transform of the sequence ((a_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}), then (z A(z)) is the z-transform of the sequence ((0,a_0,a_1,\\dots)), that is, shifted by 1. This implies that sequences that satisfy a linear difference equation lead to rational z-transforms.\n  Multiplication by a polynomial: If (A) is the z-transform of ((a_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}), then (z \\mapsto z A’(z)) is the (z)-transform of ((k a_k)_{k \\geqslant 0}). Thus, when we have a difference equation with rational coefficients (in (k)), this leads to an ordinary differential equation for the z-transform.\n\n\nClassical use of the z-transform method to derive asymptotic equivalents. The z-transform method is a classical tool, with already many applications, e.g., in combinatorics, analysis of recurrence relations, queuing theory, signal processing, and control (see [6, 7]). In this blog post, I will focus on optimization of quadratic functions.\n\nGradient descent and spectral dimension\n\nLike in an earlier post, we consider an idealized quadratic optimization problem in infinite dimension, which can be rewritten as the minimization of \\(F(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\eta-\\eta\\_\\ast, H ( \\eta-\\eta\\_\\ast)\\rangle,\\) where (\\eta_\\ast) is a global optimum of (F) and (H) the positive semi-definite Hessian operator. Gradient descent leads to the recursion \\(\\eta\\_k = \\eta\\_{k-1} \\, – \\gamma F'(\\eta\\_{k-1}) = \\eta\\_{k-1} \\, – \\gamma H ( \\eta\\_{k-1} \\, – \\eta\\_\\ast),\\) where (\\gamma &gt; 0) is a step-size which we choose so that the operator norm of (\\gamma H) is less than one (e.g., (\\gamma \\leqslant 1/L), where (L) is the largest eigenvalue of the operator (H)). With (\\theta_k = \\eta_k \\, – \\eta_\\ast), this leads to the following linear iteration \\(\\theta\\_k = (I \\, – \\gamma H) \\theta\\_{k-1} = ( I \\, – \\gamma H)^k \\delta,\\) where (\\delta = \\theta_0 = \\eta_0\\, – \\eta_\\ast).\n\nThus, given a spectral decomposition (\\gamma H = \\sum_{i=1}^{+\\infty} \\lambda_i u_i \\otimes u_i) with eigenvalues ((\\lambda_i)_{i \\geqslant 1}) in ([0,1]) and eigenvectors ((u_i)_{i \\geqslant 1}), we get the following performance criterion \\(a\\_k = \\frac{1}{2\\gamma} \\sum\\_{i=1}^{+\\infty} \\lambda\\_i (1 \\, – \\lambda\\_i)^{2k} \\langle u\\_i,\\delta \\rangle^2 = \\int\\_{0}^1 (1 \\, – \\lambda)^{2k} d\\sigma(\\lambda),\\) where \\(d\\sigma(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2\\gamma} \\sum\\_{i=1}^{+\\infty} \\lambda\\_i \\langle u\\_i,\\delta \\rangle^2 {\\rm Dirac}(\\lambda|\\lambda\\_i)\\)\nis a weighted spectral measure, as defined in [8] in the gossip context (see this earlier post), with a z-transform equal to \\(A(z) = \\sum\\_{k=0}^{+\\infty} z^k \\int\\_0^{1 } (1-\\lambda)^{2k} d\\sigma(\\lambda)  \n= \\int\\_0^{1 } \\frac{1}{1 \\, – z (1-\\lambda)^{2}} d\\sigma(\\lambda),\\) which is a rational function in (z) and (\\lambda). It can thus be re-written as, using a partial function decomposition in the variable (\\lambda), as \\(A(z) = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{z} } \\int\\_0^{1 } \\frac{d\\sigma(\\lambda) }{ \\lambda + z^{-1/2} \\, – 1 } – \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{z}} \\int\\_0^{1 } \\frac{d\\sigma(\\lambda) }{ \\lambda\\, – z^{-1/2} – 1 }.\\) We thus get \\(A(z) = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{z} } S( z^{-1/2}-1 ) – \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{z}}S ( – z^{-1/2}-1) ,\\)\nwhere (\\displaystyle S(u) = \\int_0^1 ! \\frac{d\\sigma(\\lambda)}{\\lambda + u}) is the Stieltjes transform of the measure (\\sigma) (see Chapter 8 of [10]), a classical tool in random matrix theory. We see above that what matters in the equivalent of (S(u)) around (u=0) (since the value at (-2) is bounded).\n\nThe spectral dimension defined by [8] corresponds to a measure whose behavior around zero has density (c \\lambda^{\\omega \\, – 1}), or in almost equivalent terms so that (S(u) \\sim c \\Gamma(\\omega) \\Gamma(1-\\omega) u^{\\omega\\, -1}) around (u=0), with a similar expansion for derivatives. This leads directly to a an explicit scaling law in ({1}/{k^\\omega}) which exactly recovers an earlier post (which was using Laplace method) with a different proof.\n\nThe spectral dimension depends explicitly on problem parameters:\n\n\n  For least-squares regression, as described in an earlier post and in many papers, this corresponds to (\\lambda_i \\sim L / i^\\alpha) (“capacity” conditions) and (\\langle \\delta, u_i \\rangle \\sim \\Delta / i^{\\beta/2}) (“source” conditions), leading to (\\omega = \\frac{\\beta-1}{\\alpha} + 1 ) assumed to be positive, and (c = \\frac{L \\Delta^2 }{2 \\alpha (\\gamma L)^{\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\alpha}+1}}). The equivalent is then \\(a\\_ k \\sim c \\frac{\\Gamma(\\omega)}{(2k)^{\\omega}},\\) with nice connections with non-asymptotic bounds for the same problem.\n  For gossip, as shown in [8], we get that (\\omega) is the underlying dimension of the set on which local messages are sent.\n\n\nSummary. Linear iterations lead to rational z-transforms along all eigenvectors, and then asymptotics of the Stieltjes transform (based on the spectral dimension) can be used after partial function decomposition. For gradient descent (a simple linear iteration with constant coefficients), this can be easily achieved in other ways. However, for time-dependent coefficients (Nesterov acceleration) and for stochastic iterations, it will provide a new direct way that avoids lengthy computations.\n\nNesterov acceleration vs. heavy-ball\n\nA classical way to accelerate the convergence of the gradient iteration is to use an extrapolation step due to Nesterov [11]. This can be formulated with two sequences (and a first-order recursion) as:\n\\(\\begin{array}{rcl} \\eta\\_{k+1} &amp; = &amp; \\zeta\\_{k} \\, – \\gamma F'(\\zeta\\_{k}) \\\\ \\zeta\\_{k+1} &amp; = &amp; \\eta\\_{k+1} + ( 1 \\, – \\tau\\_{k+1}) ( \\eta\\_{k+1} \\, – \\eta\\_k), \\end{array}\\) and with a single sequence (and a second-order recursion) as \\(\\eta\\_{k+1} = \\eta\\_{k} + ( 1 \\, – \\tau\\_{k}) ( \\eta\\_{k}\\, – \\eta\\_{k-1})\\, – \\gamma F’ \\big[ \\eta\\_{k} + ( 1 \\,- \\tau\\_{k}) ( \\eta\\_{k} \\, – \\eta\\_{k-1})\\big].\\)\n\nIn the original formulation with convex functions, (\\tau_k) is chosen asymptotically proportional to (2\\rho/(k+1)) with (\\rho = 3/2). For quadratic functions, [9] argues that the choice (\\rho = 1) is more natural as it leads to a simple rescaled reformulation, and [12, 13] consider a general (\\rho). We now show that the z-transform allows us to analyze all integers (\\rho), with a conjecture that is empirically valid for all (\\rho &gt;0).\n\nWith (\\theta_k = \\eta_k\\, – \\eta_\\ast), we obtain the following recursion for quadratic functions \\(\\theta\\_{k+1} = ( I- \\gamma H) \\bigg[ \\theta\\_{k} + \\Big( 1\\, – \\frac{ 2\\rho }{k+2\\rho-1} \\Big) ( \\theta\\_{k} \\, – \\theta\\_{k-1}) \\bigg].\\) I show in [1] how the performance measure leads to an explicit rational function in ((z,\\lambda)) of order (2 \\rho), obtained through differentiations of the z-transform (to take into account the rational depence of (\\tau_k)). For (\\rho=1), we can easily get by hand a partial function decomposition, while for larger integer (\\rho), this can be readily done by symbolic computation tools such as Mathematica. Overall, the final equivalents for (a_k = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\eta_k \\, – \\eta_\\ast, H ( \\eta_k \\, – \\eta_\\ast) \\rangle) are essentially (up to logarithmic terms) proportional to ({1}/{k^{\\min{2\\omega, \\omega + \\rho}}}). More precisely we get totally explicit equivalents:\n\n\n  (\\displaystyle a_k \\sim c \\frac{\\Gamma(2 \\rho)^2}{\\Gamma(\\rho)^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(\\rho-\\omega) \\Gamma(\\omega)}{\\Gamma(4\\rho-1-2\\omega)} \\frac{\\Gamma(2\\rho-1/2-\\omega)}{\\Gamma(\\rho+1/2-\\omega)} \\frac{2^{2\\rho-1}}{4^\\omega } \\cdot \\frac{1}{k^{ 2\\omega}}) for (\\omega \\in (0,\\rho)).\n  (\\displaystyle a_k \\sim c \\frac{\\Gamma(2 \\rho)^2}{\\Gamma(\\rho)^2} \\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{2\\rho-1}} \\cdot \\frac{ \\log k}{k^{2\\rho}}) for (\\omega = \\rho).\n  (\\displaystyle a_k \\sim c \\frac{\\Gamma(2 \\rho)^2}{\\Gamma(\\rho)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{2\\rho-1}} \\Gamma(\\omega-\\rho)\\cdot \\frac{1}{k^{\\omega+\\rho}}) for (\\omega &gt; \\rho).\n\n\nAnd amazingly, they do match in our experiments even beyond integer (\\rho), as shown below.\n\n\n\nNesterov acceleration for (\\omega = 1) and several (\\rho)’s. Note the classical vanishing oscillations for small (\\rho). Moreover, the best performance is achieved around (\\rho \\approx \\omega).\n\nWhat about heavy-ball? The heavy-ball method is very similar to Nesterov acceleration, with the following iteration \\(\\eta\\_{k+1} = \\eta\\_{k} \\, – \\gamma F'(\\eta\\_k) + (1-\\tau\\_{k+1}) ( \\eta\\_k \\,- \\eta\\_{k-1}),\\) leading to, with the same notations, to \\(\\theta\\_{k+1} = \\Big( I- \\frac{k}{k+2\\rho-1} \\gamma H\\Big) \\theta\\_{k} + \\Big( 1 \\, – \\frac{ 2\\rho }{k+2\\rho-1} \\Big) ( \\theta\\_{k} \\, – \\theta\\_{k-1}).\\) The associated z-transform is also the integral with respect to the spectral measure of a rational function, leading to an asymptotic equivalent around (z=1^-). Then, one can plot the actual performance and compare to the equivalent, as shown below.\n\n\n\nHeavy-ball method with (\\rho=1) for two values of the spectral dimension (\\omega). Top: performance (a_k) vs. equivalent (\\bar{a}_k), bottom: ratio.\n\nWhat’s happening? The two do not match for (\\omega) large enough (right plot above). It turns out that oscillations do not vanish, and the sufficient Tauberian conditions are not satisfied. What can then be shown in terms of asymptotic equivalents remains open.\n\nStochastic gradient descent (a.k.a. least-mean-squares algorithm)\n\nWe now consider minimizing the expexted risk for a linear predictor with square loss: \\(F(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E} \\big[ ( y \\, – \\langle x, \\eta \\rangle )^2 \\big]\\) (keeping in mind that we can use a feature vector). Single-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) leads to the iteration \\(\\eta\\_k = \\eta\\_{k-1}\\, – \\gamma ( \\langle x\\_k,\\eta\\_{k-1} \\rangle \\,- y\\_k) x\\_k,\\) with ((x_k,y_k)) an independent sample from the distribution defining (F). We can write it using a minimizer (\\eta_\\ast) of (F) as \\(\\eta\\_k -\\eta\\_\\ast =( I \\, – \\gamma x\\_k \\otimes x\\_k) (\\eta\\_{k-1} \\, – \\eta\\_\\ast) + \\gamma \\varepsilon\\_k x\\_k,\\) where (\\varepsilon_k = y_k \\, – \\langle x_k, \\eta_\\ast \\rangle) is the optimal residual. We denote (\\theta_k = \\eta_k \\, – \\eta_\\ast). In this context, SGD is referred to as the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm [14, 15, 16, 17].\n\nThe simplest but incomplete analysis uses that (\\mathbb{E} [ \\varepsilon_k x_k ] =0) (which is the optimality condition characterizing (\\varepsilon_k)), to get: \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\theta\\_k] = ( I \\, – \\gamma H) \\mathbb{E}[\\theta\\_{k-1}],\\) leading to the classical linear iteration of gradient descent. However, it does not lead to any result on the performance measure (\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E} [ \\langle \\theta_k, H \\theta_k \\rangle] = \\mathbb{E} [ F(\\eta_k)\\, – F(\\eta_\\ast) ]).\n\n\n  \n    \n      Traditionally, there are two terms in the analysis: “bias” and “variance” (see a thorough discussion in [27]). For simplicity, let’s assume that (\\varepsilon_k) is independent of (x_k), with (\\mathbb{E} [ \\varepsilon_k]=0) and (\\mathbb{E} [ \\varepsilon_k^2]=\\sigma^2) (not to be confused with the notation for the spectral measure defined above). We then consider the operator \\(\\Theta\\_k = (\\eta\\_k \\, – \\eta\\_\\ast)\\otimes (\\eta\\_k \\,- \\eta\\_\\ast) = \\theta\\_k \\otimes \\theta\\_k,\\) for which we have \\(F(\\eta\\_k) \\,- F(\\eta\\_\\ast) = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\Theta\\_k,H \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}{\\rm tr}( \\Theta\\_k H),\\) and $$ \\mathbb{E} [ \\Theta_k\n      \\Theta_{k-1}] = \\mathbb{E} \\big[ ( I \\, – \\gamma x_k \\otimes x_k) \\otimes ( I \\, – \\gamma x_k \\otimes x_k) \\big] \\Theta_{k-1} + \\gamma^2 \\sigma^2 H,\\(leading to:\\) \\mathbb{E} [ \\Theta_k ] = \\big( I\\, – \\gamma H \\otimes I \\, – \\gamma I \\otimes H\\, + \\gamma^2 \\mathbb{E} [ x \\otimes x \\otimes x \\otimes x] \\big) \\mathbb{E} [ \\Theta_{k-1} ] \\, + \\gamma^2 \\sigma^2 H.$$\n    \n  \n\n\nWe consider the operator (defined on self-adjoint operators) \\(T = H \\otimes I \\, + I \\otimes H \\, -\\, \\gamma \\mathbb{E} [ x \\otimes x \\otimes x \\otimes x],\\) so that \\(\\tag{1} \\mathbb{E} [ \\Theta\\_k ] = \\big( I\\, – \\gamma T \\big) \\mathbb{E} [ \\Theta\\_{k-1} ] \\, + \\gamma^2 \\sigma^2 H,\\) leading to, after summation of the geometric series (see an earlier post): \\(\\mathbb{E} [ \\Theta\\_k ] = \\big( I\\, – \\gamma T \\big)^k \\Theta\\_{0} \\, + \\gamma \\sigma^2 \\big[ I- \\big( I- \\gamma T \\big)^k \\big] T^{-1} H .\\)\n\nA sufficient condition for convergence is that the operator (I\\, – \\gamma T) (as an operator on symmetric operators) has eigenvalues in ([-1,1]). In [17], we define and characterize the largest step-size with few assumptions. We consider instead specific models for asymptotic computations.\n\nSimplest model. In order to obtain simpler formulas, several models have been proposed that are compatible with the Hessian operator (H) having eigenvalues ((\\lambda_i)_{i \\geqslant 1}) and eigenvectors ((u_i)_{i \\geqslant 1}). The simplest model [18] is (x = r u_j) with (r \\in \\mathbb{R}) and (i \\in \\mathbb{N}^\\ast) random and independent, with (\\mathbb{E}[r^2] = \\sum_{i \\geqslant 1} h_i = {\\rm tr}(H)), and (\\mathbb{P}(j = i) = h_i / {\\rm tr}(H)). What makes this model special is that, like in the deterministic case, there are no interactions between eigensubspaces. While this includes one-hot encoded discrete data as recently used in [19], this remains limited compared to the model below (which includes Gaussian data and is often used in random matrix theory).\n\nSimplified high-dimensional model. We consider \\(x= \\sum\\_{i = 1}^{+\\infty} h\\_i^{1/2} z\\_i u\\_i,\\) where the variables (z_i \\in \\mathbb{R}), (i \\geqslant 1), are independent (and not merely un-correlated), and have zero mean and unit variance. The only parameter that we will need to characterize the operator (T) is the fourth-order moment, (\\mathbb{E} [ z_i^2] = 3 + \\kappa), where (\\kappa) is the excess kurtosis.\n\nThe Gaussian model [15] where all (z_i) are Gaussians corresponds to (\\kappa=0), while the Rademacher model where (z_i \\in {-1,1}) are Rademacher random variables corresponds to the smallest possible value (\\kappa=-2). Other models could also be considered, particularly when using kernels [25].\n\nWith this simplified model, as already shown in the 1980’s in the Gaussian context [20, 15], in the basis of eigenvectors of (H), the operator (T) has a simple block-diagonal structure: the off-diagonal elements of (\\mathbb{E} \\big[ \\Theta_k ] ) evolve independently (and converge to zero linearly), while the diagonal elements that are needed to compute the performance measure evolve according to a linear iteration with a matrix that is the sum of a diagonal and a rank-one matrix. More precisely, assuming without loss of generality that the operator (H) is diagonal equal to ({\\rm Diag}(h)), Eq. ((1)) projected on diagonal elements becomes \\({\\rm diag}( \\mathbb{E}[ \\Theta\\_k]) = ( I\\, – \\gamma V) {\\rm diag}( \\mathbb{E}[ \\Theta\\_k]) + \\gamma^2 \\sigma^2 h,\\) with \\(V = {\\rm Diag}\\big( 2 h \\, – \\gamma(\\kappa+2) h \\circ h\\big) – \\gamma h \\otimes h .\\)\n\nThe performance (a_k = \\mathbb{E} [ F(\\eta_k) ] – F(\\eta_\\ast)) is thus \\(a\\_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\delta \\circ \\delta, ( I \\, – \\gamma V )^k h \\rangle + \\gamma \\sigma^2 \\langle h, \\big(I\\, – ( I \\, – \\gamma V )^k \\big) V^{-1} h \\rangle.\\) In order to study convergence, we could look at an eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix (V) using “secular” equations [21]. Instead, we will use the z-transform method, which avoids explicit computations of eigenvalues.\n\nFor simplicity, we consider here only the interpolation regime where (\\sigma^2=0) (i.e., there is no noise on top of optimal predictions, see [1] for all details). Then, the z-transform is equal to \\(A(z) = \\sum\\_{k=0}^{+\\infty} a\\_k z^k = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\delta \\circ \\delta, ( (1-z) I \\, + z \\gamma V )^{-1} h \\rangle.\\) The matrix ((1-z) I \\, + z \\gamma V) that needs to be inverted has a “diagonal + rank-one” structure, and can thus be inverted using the matrix inversion lemma, leading to an explicit rational function in (z), that can be directly analyzed around (z = 1) (see [1]).\n\nAsymptotic equivalent. Following this post and the gradient descent analysis above, we consider (h_i = {L}/{i^\\alpha}) and (\\delta_i = {\\Delta}/{i^{\\beta/2}}). If we assume (\\kappa = -2) (Rademacher case, which leads to the simplest formulas), the largest step-size is (\\gamma = 2/ {\\rm tr}(H)) (which can be significantly smaller than (2 / \\lambda_\\max(H)) when (\\alpha) is close to 1), and we get the asymptotic equivalent \\(a\\_k \\sim \\frac{L \\Delta^2}{2 \\alpha} \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma {\\rm tr}(H)/2 } \\frac{\\Gamma(\\omega)}{(2 \\gamma L k)^{\\omega}},\\) with (\\omega= (\\beta-1)/\\alpha + 1), and under the condition (\\omega = (0, 2- 1/\\alpha)) (see [1] for a result for all cases). Up to constants, this leads to the same equivalent as for gradient descent. See below for an illustration.\n\n\n\nComparison of asymptotic equivalent and performance of SGD in the interpolation regime for several replications for (\\omega=1).\n\nWe recover the results from [22] with a simpler and more direct proof, thereby obtaining asymptotic results that complement the non-asymptotic results from [23]. This is also a subcase of results from [24] with a simpler proof. Various extensions are possible, e.g., using averaging of iterates, or computing estimates of the variance of the performance (and not only its expectation); see [1] for details.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this blog post, I have shown how the z-transform can be used to derive asymptotic equivalents of sequences that naturally appear in the optimization of quadratic forms, with classical tools such as acceleration and stochastic approximation. In all cases, the z-transform method allows simple computations of asymptotic equivalents (e.g., scaling laws) through the expansion of rational functions.\n\nSince quadratic functions are at the heart of optimization, many recent developments can be considered as candidates for the z-transform method, such as Richardson extrapolation, non-linear iterations for generic convex functions, time-varying coefficients beyond rational functions, mixing momentum techniques and SGD [26, 26], primal-dual algorithms, variance reduced methods, or sampling techniques. Many situations where the z-transform can prove useful!\n\nWhere does the “z” come from? For those questioning the naming of the z-transform, the wikipedia page has some interesting historical notes. The idea of using generating functions to study sequences dates back at least to De Moivre around 1730, while its first use in discrete engineering systems was done by Witold Hurewicz in 1947 using the letter “z” (to make it different from the letter “s” used for the Laplace transform (its continuous-time counterpart). The name z-transform was later coined in 1952 by John R. Ragazzini and Lofti Zadeh. As confirmed by a personal communication from Lofti Zadeh to Murat Arcak, It has nothing to do with the first letter of Loftis Zadeh’s name (“I used the letter z not because of my name but because in the mathematical literature on difference equations, z was the symbol that was used”). However, I didn’t find any formal confirmation that Zorro had nothing to do with it.\n\nAcknowledgements.

An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\nFurther, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising.

A\nseminal theorem of Hell and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il asserts that the $H$-Coloring\nproblem is NP-hard whenever $H$ is loopless and non-bipartite. A result of\nJansen and Pieterse implies that for every graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem\nparameterized by the vertex cover number $k$ admits a kernel with\n$O(k^{\\Delta(H)})$ vertices and bit-size bounded by $O(k^{\\Delta(H)} \\cdot \\log\nk)$, where $\\Delta(H)$ denotes the maximum degree in $H$. For the case where\n$H$ is a complete graph on at least three vertices, this kernel size nearly\nmatches conditional lower bounds established by Jansen and Kratsch and by\nJansen and Pieterse.\nThis paper presents new upper and lower bounds on the kernel size of\n$H$-Coloring problems parameterized by the vertex cover number. The upper\nbounds arise from two kernelization algorithms. The first is purely\ncombinatorial, and its size is governed by a structural quantity of the graph\n$H$, called the non-adjacency witness number. As applications, we obtain\nkernels whose size is bounded by a fixed polynomial for natural classes of\ngraphs $H$ with unbounded maximum degree. More strikingly, we show that for\nalmost every graph $H$, the degree of the polynomial that bounds the size of\nour combinatorial kernel grows only logarithmically in $\\Delta(H)$. Our second\nkernel leverages linear-algebraic tools and involves the notion of faithful\nindependent representations of graphs. It strengthens the general bound from\nprior work and, among other applications, yields near-optimal kernels for\nproblems concerning the dimension of orthogonal graph representations over\nfinite fields.

Central to these methods is the task of constructing a sparse\nnavigable search graph for a given dataset endowed with a distance function.\nUnfortunately, doing so is computationally expensive, so heuristics are\nuniversally used in practice.\nIn this work, we initiate the study of fast algorithms with provable\nguarantees for search graph construction. For a dataset with $n$ data points,\nthe problem of constructing an optimally sparse navigable graph can be framed\nas $n$ separate but highly correlated minimum set cover instances. This yields\na naive $O(n^3)$ time greedy algorithm that returns a navigable graph whose\nsparsity is at most $O(\\log n)$ higher than optimal. We improve significantly\non this baseline, taking advantage of correlation between the set cover\ninstances to leverage techniques from streaming and sublinear-time set cover\nalgorithms. Combined with problem-specific pre-processing techniques, we\npresent an $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ time algorithm for constructing an $O(\\log\nn)$-approximate sparsest navigable graph under any distance function.\nThe runtime of our method is optimal up to logarithmic factors under the\nStrong Exponential Time Hypothesis via a reduction from Monochromatic Closest\nPair. Moreover, we prove that, as with general set cover, obtaining better than\nan $O(\\log n)$-approximation is NP-hard, despite the significant additional\nstructure present in the navigable graph problem. Finally, we show that our\ntechniques can also beat cubic time for the closely related and practically\nimportant problems of constructing $\\alpha$-shortcut reachable and\n$\\tau$-monotonic graphs, which are also used for nearest neighbor search. For\nsuch graphs, we obtain $\\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$ time or better algorithms.\n\nRead original post\n"

As the scales of graph databases have increased tremendously\nin recent years, large-scale graphs G are often disk-resident. Obtaining the\nBFS results of G in semi-external memory model is inevitable, because the\nin-memory BFS algorithm has to maintain the entire G in the main memory, and\nexternal BFS algorithms consume high computational costs. As a good trade-off\nbetween the internal and external memory models, semi-external memory model\nassumes that the main memory can at least reside a spanning tree of G.\nNevertheless, the semi-external BFS problem is still an open issue due to its\ndifficulty. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive study for processing\nBFS in semi-external memory model. After discussing the naive solutions based\non the basic framework of semi-external graph algorithms, this paper presents\nan efficient algorithm, named EP-BFS, with a small minimum memory space\nrequirement, which is an important factor for evaluating semi-external\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic\nlarge-scale graphs, where graph WDC-2014 contains over 1.7 billion nodes, and\ngraph eu-2015 has over 91 billion edges.

      "content": "Authors: Chenhao Wang\n\nA $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by\ntaking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We\nfurther show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone\nproblem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from\n(Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\\tilde O(n^2k^2)$\ntime.\nThe proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from\nan optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to\nevaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous\nanalysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved\napproximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method\nnaturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "\n\nScrolling through the deluge of people advertising their ICML papers on social media, I found myself bedeviled by a philosophical question about the logical reconstruction of machine learning. In the most famous machine learning papers, the central claims take the form:\n\nY is predictable from X, and method M demonstrates a particular accuracy on this prediction problem.\n\nThe AlexNet paper showed that ImageNet image classes were predictable from images, and a convolutional neural network achieved high accuracy. The GPT3 paper achieved high accuracy on a variety of natural language processing prediction problems with one-shot learning and transformer-based large language models. The Support Vector Network paper showed that support vector machines could recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy.\n\nIn these descriptions, I am being vague today about what precisely “X” and “Y” are. “X” could be streams of text, images, or electronic health records. “Y” could be translations, image classes, or cancer diagnoses. How papers build up these constructs and concepts also bugs me, but I will leave a full logical reconstruction of machine learning for another blog post.1\n\nToday, I am interested in understanding the papers that argue the negative claim and whether they ever provide useful evidence. That is, the papers that assert:\n\nY is not predictable from X.\n\nI call claims of this form “unpredictability arguments.” Papers making unpredictability arguments can get a lot of temporary traction in machine learning discourse. They give fuel to the petty battles inside the community. In our current landscape, they give ammunition for lay critiques of industry. They can even help bring on AI Winters if people take them seriously enough. The problem is they are much harder to justify as stated.\n\nUnpredictability arguments can be purely theoretical. These might say something like “under this list of assumptions about how data is generated and this list of assumptions about how you build the prediction function, Y is not predictable from X.” Such arguments can be helpful for conceptualization, but they are too strongly tied to their assumptions. Yes, simple linear perceptrons can’t build an XOR of input bits. But simple multilayer perceptrons can. Moreover, if your prediction function is allowed to include simple numerical transformations of the input data, all of a sudden XOR is predictable by linear functions (that is, just add XOR as a feature.).\n\nTheory bounds are weak because practitioners (and theorists for that matter) can simply change the rules. Yes, you can tell me that under some very contrived scenario, I can’t build a particular computer program. But machine learning practice is the apotheosis of computer science, fully embracing a Feyerabendian zeal for anything goes. I can always disagree with your assessment of how data is collected, generated, and processed. And there are an infinite number of computer programs I can write in PyTorch to disprove your unpredictability assertion.\n\nMinsky and Papert’s arguments that I’m alluding to above—about whether perceptrons can compute parity—are a notable exception that proves the rule. No one really understands their arguments, and if you believed them without really digging into the details or trying some simple alternative prediction programs, you would have abandoned supervised learning for decades (oh wait, that’s actually what happened).\n\nNow, what about experimental bounds? If someone writes a paper saying, “I did procedure P and found transformers were really bad at predicting Y from X,” what does this tell us? I’ve seen a lot of papers make such claims concerning LLMs and transformers. You’ll have people saying, “See, LLMs are stochastic parrots,” or “See, LLMs just learn epicycles.” In these papers, the predictability of the Y value is supposed to be obvious to the reader, and we’re supposed to be shocked that some machine learning model can’t predict it.\n\nSure, people can say all they want. As someone who wants better critiques of predictions, I’m never convinced by these papers, no matter how frequently they capture a viral zeitgeist. In the spirit of a Lakatosian offense, I can always counter by tweeting “your procedure is pretty arbitrary, my friend,” or “i don’t think that baseline is fair,” or “skill issue.” There is no reason to believe that the code shared in such papers is the only way for a method to predict Y from X. There is an infinite regress of hyperparameters, optimization variants, and so on. You only have so many forking paths you can explore in the garden before the conference deadline.\n\nMost people would find competitions to be more compelling evidence. Machine learning is built upon competitive testing, leading to breakthroughs in proving Y predictable from X. Everyone loves the ImageNet competition. Benchmark scores are a central part of how companies showcase their latest language models. Can competitive testing “prove” Y is unpredictable?\n\nWhat do we conclude when machine learning competitions fail? A notable example of failure is the Future of Families Challenge (formerly known as the Fragile Families Challenge). The goal here was to predict certain socioeconomic outcomes from complex, unstructured data recorded about a large birth cohort. After hundreds of researchers tried to predict the outcomes, the study concluded that the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model.”\n\nWhat should we conclude from this competition? We could conclude that the Ys in this paper (including “material hardship,” GPA, “grit,” and eviction) are not predictable from the Xs. I could also conclude that poor predictability arises because the data is far worse than advertised (e.g., there is a lot of missing data in the dataset). I could conclude that the targets studied have poor construct validity. There’s a long line of objections that I can string together even when a competitive test fails to find predictability.\n\nIn any event, I don’t have good answers for how to think about this aspect of the philosophy of machine learning yet. I’m very much thinking out loud today! But I’m posting because I’d love to hear your thoughts on what would constitute compelling evidence to prove the impossibility of prediction.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nReally, it should be a paper. Let me know if you are soliciting invitations for special issues on the philosophy of engineering.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

The problem is famous for its intriguing properties and for evading\nstandard techniques for designing and analyzing online algorithms. Even on\nuniform metric spaces with sufficiently many points, the deterministic\ncompetitive ratio of weighted $k$-server is known to increase doubly\nexponentially with respect to $k$, while the behavior of its randomized\ncompetitive ratio is not fully understood. Specifically, no upper bound better\nthan doubly exponential is known, while the best known lower bound is singly\nexponential in $k$. In this paper, we close the exponential gap between these\nbounds by giving an $\\exp(O(k^2))$-competitive randomized online algorithm for\nthe weighted $k$-server problem on uniform metrics, thus breaking the doubly\nexponential barrier for deterministic algorithms for the first time. This is\nachieved by a recursively defined notion of a phase which, on the one hand,\nforces a lower bound on the cost of any offline solution, while, on the other\nhand, also admits a randomized online algorithm with bounded expected cost. The\nalgorithm is also recursive; it involves running several algorithms virtually\nand in parallel and following the decisions of one of them in a random order.\nWe also show that our techniques can be lifted to construct an\n$\\exp(O(k^2))$-competitive randomized online algorithm for the generalized\n$k$-server problem on weighted uniform metrics.\n\nRead original post\n"

Although conjectured to be\nPSPACE-complete, it remains open whether Pinwheel Scheduling is NP-hard (unless\na compact input encoding is used) or even contained in NP.\nWe introduce k-Visits, a finite version of Pinwheel Scheduling, where given n\ndeadlines, the goal is to schedule each task exactly k times. While we observe\nthat the 1-Visit problem is trivial, we prove that 2-Visits is strongly\nNP-complete through a surprising reduction from Numerical 3-Dimensional\nMatching (N3DM). As intermediate steps in the reduction, we define NP-complete\nvariants of N3DM which may be of independent interest. We further extend our\nstrong NP-hardness result to a generalization of k-Visits $k\\geq 2$ in which\nthe deadline of each task may vary throughout the schedule, as well as to a\nsimilar generalization of Pinwheel Scheduling, thus making progress towards\nsettling the complexity of Pinwheel Scheduling.\nAdditionally, we prove that 2-Visits can be solved in linear time if all\ndeadlines are distinct, rendering it one of the rare natural problems which\nexhibit the interesting dichotomy of being in P if their input is a set and\nNP-complete if the input is a multiset. We achieve this through a Turing\nreduction from 2-Visits to a variation of N3DM, which we call Position\nMatching. Based on this reduction, we also show an FPT algorithm for 2-Visits\nparameterized by a value related to how close the input deadlines are to each\nother, as well as a linear-time algorithm for instances with up to two distinct\ndeadlines.\n\nRead original post\n"

The introduction of optical switches in DCNs as a future-proof\nsolution exacerbates this problem due to several properties of optical\nswitches, such as the fact that they are generally bufferless and therefore\nrely on centralized scheduling, and that they have long switching times and\ntherefore require the number of rearrangements to be minimized.\nIn this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling algorithm that achieves\ntheoretical maximum throughput even in one-rate bidirectional Clos networks,\nwhile producing schemes with near-minimal numbers of rearrangements. It is the\nonly algorithm that directly supports bidirectional Clos networks and has a\ntime efficiency high enough to support dynamic scheduling to date. For static\nminimal rewiring, its running time ranges from a fraction to a few hundredths\nof other algorithms, and the number of rearrangements has also been steadily\nimproved, allowing for more frequent adjustments and less impact on ongoing\ncommunications.

      "content": "Interactive proofs of proximity (IPPs) are a relaxation of interactive proofs, analogous to property testing, in which soundness is required to hold only for inputs that are far from the property being verified. In such proof systems, the verifier has oracle access to the input, and it engages in two types of activities before making its decision: querying the input oracle and communicating with the prover. The main objective is to achieve protocols where both the query and communication complexities are extremely low.\nOf particular interest are IPPs in which the querying and the interacting activities are performed independently, with no information flow from one activity to the other. Such IPPs were systematically studied by Goldreich, Rothblum, and Skverer (ITCS 2023), who introduced two variants: the pre-coordinated model, where the querying and interacting activities may use a common source of randomness, and the isolated model, where the two activities are fully independent, each operating with a separate source of randomness.\nWe focus on what is possible under these models when soundness is relaxed to computational soundness. Our previous work (ECCC, TR24-131) showed that the pre-coordinated model becomes significantly more powerful under this relaxation. In this work, we consider the isolated model under the same relaxation and show a separation between the two models. We consider a property that, by our previous work, has a computationally sound IPP in the pre-coordinated model with poly-logarithmic complexities (assuming the existence of collision-resistant hashing functions), and show that any computationally sound IPP in the isolated model for this property must have either query complexity or communication complexity that is $n^{\\Omega(1)}$, where $n$ is the length of the input.\n\nRead original post\n"

Escher’s Drawing Hands and Johann Sebastian Bach’s Canon a 2 per tonos, a piece that keeps rising until it ends a whole tone higher than it started.\n\nI’d prefer to focus less on the paradoxes and self-reference to the true beauty and complexity of computation. So now having had a long career in the field, who would I call on to capture the power and beauty of computing?\n\nIt has to start with Alan Turing. His seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem gives a clean model for computation and still the best argument (Section 9) for why this simple model captures everything computable. The Entscheidungsproblem, that you can’t mechanize all of mathematics, comes as a consequence, not as a goal of the paper. In a much later paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, he shows how the beauty of nature can emerge naturally from computation, which of course we now know much better arises from discrete DNA sequences.\n\nFor music, instead of Bach’s abstract works, I prefer to focus on the emotional power of music that still arises from a musical score that is not unlike a computer program in the way it lays out the composition. Take for example Richard Wagner’s Prelude and Liebestod (the beginning and the end of his opera Tristan and Isolde). It captures the tension of the two lovers from the very first notes and keeps that tension going until it resolves at the very end.\n\nWhile soccer and basketball have mostly continuous play, I prefer that great American game of baseball that after each pitch has a very discrete state space that stadiums would capture with a few light bulbs (strikes, balls, outs), and yet could keep the excitement and tension on every one of those pitches. No one dominated the game more in his time than George Herman “Babe” Ruth, who I might have admittedly also chose to keep the same syllable cadence as Hofstadter.\n\nSo let’s thank Turing, Wagner, Ruth, and the many others that showed we can show how incredible complexity and beauty can arise in the simplicity of computation. So many stories to tell.\n\nBy Lance Fortnow\n\nRead original post\n"

Motivated by this\nquestion, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there\nexists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove\nthat this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games\nwith perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result,\nwe also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria\nin this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising\ncomplexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally\nsimpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in\nextensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably\nharder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by\n[VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium\n(EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult\nthe Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it\nis NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our\nhardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the\nThreshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including\nEFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer\nstochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness\nby providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results.\nTogether, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the\ncomplexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "A zero-knowledge proof demonstrates that a fact (like that a Sudoku puzzle has a solution) is true while, counterintuitively, revealing nothing else (like what the solution actually is). This remarkable guarantee is extremely useful in cryptographic applications, but it comes at a cost. A classical impossibility result by Goldreich and Oren [J. Cryptol. ‘94] shows that zero-knowledge proofs must necessarily sacrifice basic properties of traditional mathematical proofs — namely perfect soundness (that no proof of a false statement exists) and non-interactivity (that a proof can be transmitted in a single message).\nContrary to this impossibility, we show that zero-knowledge with perfect soundness and no interaction is effectively possible. We do so by defining and constructing a powerful new relaxation of zero-knowledge. Intuitively, while the classical zero-knowledge definition requires that an object called a simulator actually exists, our new definition only requires that one cannot rule out that a simulator exists (in a particular logical sense). Using this, we show that **every falsifiable security property of (classical) zero-knowledge can be achieved with no interaction, no setup, and perfect soundness.** This enables us to remove interaction and setup from (classical) zero-knowledge in essentially all of its applications in the literature, at the relatively mild cost that such applications now have security that is “game-based” instead of “simulation-based.”\nOur construction builds on the work of Kuykendall and Zhandry [TCC ‘20] and relies on two central, longstanding, and well-studied assumptions that we show are also necessary. The first is the existence of non-interactive witness indistinguishable proofs, which follows from standard assumptions in cryptography. The second is Krajícek and Pudlak’s 1989 conjecture that no optimal proof system exists. This is one of the main conjectures in the field of proof complexity and is the natural finitistic analogue of the impossibility of Hilbert’s second problem (and, hence, also Gödel’s incompleteness theorem). Our high-level idea is to use these assumptions to construct a prover and verifier where no simulator exists, but the non-existence of a simulator is independent (in the logical sense of unprovability) of an arbitrarily strong logical system. One such logical system is the standard axioms of mathematics: ZFC.\n\nRead original post\n"

Much of the seminar was about the the paper Product Mixing in Compact Lie Groups by David Ellis, Guy Kindler, Noam Lifshitz, and Dor Minzer.\n\nLecture I: Noam Lifshitz\n\n\n\nNoam Lifshitz (HUJI): Product mixing in groups (Special Colloquium)\n\nAbstract: Let  be subsets of the special unitary group  of Haar measure . Then . In fact, the product  of random elements  is equidistributed in  This makes progress on a question that was posed independently by Gowers studying nonabelian variants of questions from additive combinatorics and settles a conjecture of physicists studying quantum communication complexity. To prove our results we introduce a tool known as ‘hypercontractivity’ to the study of high rank compact Lie groups. We then show that it synergies with their representation theory to obtain our result.\n\nMy summary\n\nThe Babai–Sós Problem\n\nIn 1985, László Babai and Vera Sós posed the following question: What is the largest possible size of a product-free subset of a finite group ?\n\nFor abelian groups, one can always find a sum-free set of positive density. However, the situation in the non-commutative case is quite different—and turns out to be very interesting.\n\nGowers’ Work and the Sarnak–Xue–Gowers Lemma\n\nIn his 2008 paper quasirandom groups, Tim Gowers proved that if the dimension of the smallest non-trivial representation of a finite group is , then any product-free subset has density at most  for some constant . \nGowers also obtained an analogous result for compact Lie groups, showing that the Haar measure of a product-free set is similarly bounded. For example, for the group , any product-free set has measure at most .\n\nGowers’ argument relies (among other things) on ideas reminiscent of a 1991 result by Sarnak and Xue, which established a beautiful connection between spectral gaps and the dimensions of irreducible representations.\n\n“Gowers’s enemies are low dimensional representation”\n\nImproving on Gowers’ bound requires a more refined analysis of characteristic functions of sets, made possible by hypercontractive estimates. Hypercontractivity enables one to strengthen the upper bound for product-free sets from  to . Further improvements might still be achievable—an intriguing open direction. However, for the stronger statement concerning the equidistribution of products, this new bound is sharp.\n\nOne Clean Qubit Suffices\n\nNoam also described a related problem in quantum communication complexity, which was resolved using similar methods. This result appears in the paper One Clean Qubit Suffices for Quantum Communication Advantage by Srinivasan Arunachalam, Uma Girish, and Noam Lifshitz.\n\nHypercontractivity\n\nNoam concluded his talk by highlighting hypercontractivity—the key new ingredient in this line of work—and the associated -level inequalities. The proof of the main theorem, to be developed over four additional lectures, combines representation theory for  with the establishment and use of hypercontractive estimates.\n\n\n\nLecture II: Dor Minzer\n\nDor Minzer (MIT): On CSPs, Inverse Theorems and Friends\n\nAbstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs in short) are among the most important computational problems studied in Theoretical Computer Science. In this talk we will discuss a recent line of study addressing the complexity of approximating satisfiable instances of CSPs.\nWe will focus on connections to analytic inverse-type theorems for correlations that generalize the -Gowers norm, and show how these results can be used in other areas, such as property testing and extremal combinatorics.\n\nBased mostly on joint works with Amey Bhangale, Subhash Khot and Yang P. Liu.\n\nMy summary:\n\nCSPs and the difference between 3LIN and 3SAT\n\nIt is NP-hard to find a satisfying assignment for a 3-SAT instance—and even to satisfy a large fraction of clauses when a perfect assignment exists. The case of 3-LIN (systems of linear equations mod 2 with three variables per equation) is very different: here it is easy to find a satisfying assignment, but hard to find an assignment that satisfies many equations.\n\nBoth problems fall under the general framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Understanding the source of this difference is a deep and challenging question in computational complexity.\n\nAmey Bhangale, Subhash Khot, and Dor Minzer (recently joined by Yang P. Liu) have written a remarkable series of (so far) seven papers developing a theory to address this question; Here is a link to On Approximability of Satisfiable k-CSPs:VII.  As it turns out, combinatorial objects like combinatorial lines are special cases of a much broader family of structures arising from CSPs. This connection works both ways:\n\n\n  The general theory applies to long-standing problems in additive combinatorics.\n  At the same time, advances in additive combinatorics—via more sophisticated mathematical tools—feed back into the general CSP theory.\n\n\nBetter Bounds for Density Hales–Jewett\n\nDor highlighted a striking application of this theory (we already mentioned it in this post):\n\nReasonable Bounds for Combinatorial Lines of Length Three, by Amey Bhangale, Subhash Khot, Yang P.

We show that if A is a union of conjugacy classes of density at least  then  covers  This extends a seminal result of Larsen and Shalev (Inventiones Math., 2008) who obtained the same with 1/4 in the double exponent.\n\nThe two results boil down to the understanding of independent sets in certain Cayley graphs, and turn out to be related. We shall focus on the main new tool we use in the proof of both results – hypercontractive inequalities for global functions, developed by Keevash, Lifshitz, Long and Minzer (JAMS, 2024).\n\nThe talk was based on joint works with Noam Lifshitz, Dor Minzer, and Ohad Sheinfeld.\n\nNathan’s talk is based on these two papers:\n\nImproved covering results for conjugacy classes of symmetric groups via hypercontractivity, by Nathan Keller, Noam Lifshitz, and Ohad Sheinfeld\n\nOn t-intersecting families of permutations by Nathan Keller, Noam Lifshitz, and Ohad Sheinfeld\n\nNathan explained how Erdős–Ko–Rado-type problems about permutations in combinatorics and problems about products of conjugacy classes in group theory can both be formulated in terms of combinatorial properties of Cayley graphs of normal subsets (unions of conjugacy classes) in groups. (This explanation was quite stunning for me.) He then outlined how hypercontractive inequalities for global functions— (that we mentioned here and here) yield major advances in both of these areas.  We discussed Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel’s Erdős–Ko–Rado result for permutations in this 2009 post.\n\n##\n\nLectures IV,V,VI,VII: Guy Kindler and Noam Lifshitz\n\nHypercontractivity and product mixing in compact Lie groups (Four lectures)  Guy Kindler (HUJI) and Noam Lifshitz (HUJI)\n\nAbstract: The study of geometric properties of Cayley graphs associated with non-abelian groups is a rich area of research with wide ranging applications. Here, key questions concern properties such as expansion, mixing, diameter, etc. While remarkable progress was made in this area by applying deep results in character theory, such methods seem to be limited to the case of normal Cayley graphs (those generated by unions of conjugacy classes).\n\nIn this mini-course we explore a recent approach which seems to sidestep such limitations. Inspired by techniques originally introduced in the study of the (abelian) Boolean Cube, we use a synergy between hypercontractive inequalities and dimensional lower bounds from representation theory to make progress on various problems. In particular, we will present a significant improvement of a bound of Gowers on the measure of product-free subsets in the unitary group SU(n).\n\nMy comments: I will not give a detailed summary of the lectures by Guy and Noam. They described a subtle coupling method to prove hypercontractivity  for  and mentioned another method based on curvature. They got quite deeply into the representation theory of SU(n) and mentioned notions of “degree” (analogous to “Juntas” for Boolean functions) that plays a role. Related notions appeared in works of Shamgar Gurevich and  Roger Howe (e.g. this paper) and of Bob Guralnik, Michael Larsen, and Pham Huu Tiep (e.g., this paper). The proof presented by Noam for bounding the eigenvalues was actually a simplification discovered right before the lecture!\n\nMore\n\n\n\nOn Joram\n\nElon Lindenstrauss shared a few moving words about his father, emphasizing Joram’s deep commitment to the Israeli mathematical community. The format of Joram’s seminar—aiming not only to present high-level ideas but also to dive into the gory details of major mathematical advances—was something he greatly valued.\n\nI vividly recall a seminar Joram organized back in 1981 on the newly published book by Gromov, Structures métriques pour les variétés riemanniennes.\n\n(See also this post about Joram Lindenstrauss. Here is a link to previous seminars in the series.)\n\n\n\nDavid Ellis\n\nThe fourth author of the paper, our dear friend David Ellis, visited Jerusalem in May.\n\nVideoes\n\nVideoes for the lectures are Lecture 1, lecture 2, lecture 3, lecture 4, lecture 5, lecture 6, lecture 7. (The links may not be stable).\n\nKazhdan’s seminar on hypercontractivity – Spring 2026\n\nBack in 2003–2004, David Kazhdan and I ran a seminar on polytopes, toric varieties, and related topics in combinatorics and algebra. (Much has happened since then—Karim Adiprasito even organized another Kazhdan seminar on a related theme in 2018.)\n\nIn 2012, David and I thought it might be time to run a similar event in 2014 and perhaps start a tradition of a decennial joint seminar. This plan materialized only in 2019 when Leonid Polterovich, Dorit Aharonov, Guy Kindler, Michael Ben-Or, and I dedicated one of David’s Sunday seminars to computation, quantumness, symplectic geometry, and information.\n\nNow, we’re planning a Kazhdan seminar on hypercontractivity for Spring 2026. Since many of Kazhdan’s seminars focus on representation theory, the new connections between hypercontractivity and representations make this an especially natural fit.\n\nPlans for my blog\n\nI have plenty of material I’d love to share—from the Combinatorial Colloquium in London, the events of the Czech Learned Society in Prague, and several lectures and meetings in Israel. This summary of the very recent Joram seminar does not mean I’ve abandoned plans to write about earlier events.

      "content": "\n\nLast week, I wrote two posts on a related theme, but didn’t fully connect them to my earlier thoughts on the topic. I have a particular drum I’ve been beating consistently on this blog since I moved to Substack (and I have even older posts on it, too):\n\n\n  Though machine learning is statistical prediction, classical inferential statistics has nothing interesting to say about the field.\n  In fact, lessons from classical inferential statistics have historically provided poor, misleading guidance for machine learning practice.\n  A culture of frictionless reproducibility has been the primary driver of machine learning progress.\n\n\nI use the term classical inferential statistics loosely here, and Siva Balakrishnan is going to get mad at me about it. He and I cannot agree on a term to describe the narrow statistical subfield that I want to call out: frequentist claims about out-of-sample behavior derived from laws of large numbers and the union bound. This includes statistical significance, null hypothesis significance testing, and error bars.1\n\nI’ve decided to try out “classical” because Jessica Hullman used it in her blog post advocating for more statistics in machine learning. I always find Jessica thought-provoking, and she links to me and asks at the end of the post.\n\n\n  “But others refer to attempts to incentivize more thorough reporting of uncertainty in ML evaluation as “a weird obsession with statistics. What’s up with that, I wonder?”\n\n\nI’ll reply here, though most of what I wanted to say was already written in the comments under Jessica’s post by frequent stat modeling interlocutor Anoneuoid:\n\n\n  Mandating null hypothesis significance testing and related ideas is a fast way to stifle progress.\n  Systematic errors are more important than sampling errors.\n  Since everyone started deep learning, machine learning papers have been reduced to advertisements of pull requests.\n  You don’t need 90 pages of robustness checks or proofs, since you can simply try the code and decide for yourself whether to accept it.\n\n\nI swear I am not Anoneuoid. We just happen to strongly agree about everything.\n\nBut yes, I have made the same arguments on the blog many times. If the machine learning community had listened to the guidelines from classical inferential statistics, nothing would have ever gotten built. Machine learning was largely developed without the use of classical inferential statistics. In fact, the influence has gone in the opposite direction: since 1960, statistically minded researchers have been trying to bootstrap a “statistical learning theory” by chasing practice.\n\nThe problem is that theories derived by shoe-horning practice into classical statistical footwear haven’t been productive. Every time this narrow view of classical statistics is applied, it gives the wrong advice! It’s been actively harmful to the field. It makes incorrect predictions and obsesses about the wrong type of error.\n\nThe part of practice that most resembles classical statistics is the train-test paradigm.2 Statistics doesn’t explain why this is successful at all! If anything, this has polarized me against other conclusions drawn from statistical theory. Indeed, it makes me believe that claims about the scientific detriment of p-hacking and uncorrected multiple hypothesis testing are wildly overstated.\n\nAnother post critiquing statistics is all well and good, but I have a more important point to make here about what we might consider doing instead. Jessica writes to Anoneuoid:\n\n\n  “But I guess part of what I find confusing about dismissing attempts to hold people accountable for what they are claiming (like the crazy long NeurIPS checklist that the linked post complains about) is that in the absence of suggesting an alternative way to better align the claims and the evidence, it reads as though we’re saying all is ok as is and uncertainty can continue to be an afterthought when presenting evaluation results.”\n\n\nI often feel like the solutionist burden placed on critics is an easy way to wave off critique. But on this issue, I am actually proposing an alternative! Open models, open data, and open code are a clear, feasible alternative requirement. These are not major asks. As I said in a previous post, the only reason we don’t require these is that there are still a lot of corporate interests at the big machine learning conferences, and these places always have some argument for why they can’t release code and data. David Pfau noted on Twitter that this is rapidly changing with the LLM arms race, with the companies moving towards abandoning publishing altogether. He might be right, but that doesn’t mean we have to encourage their nefarious behavior by embracing their move to proprietary secrecy.\n\nJessica admits the problem herself in her review of Weijie Su’s argument for more statistics in machine learning research.\n\n\n  “Something a bit cringey that becomes clearer when you see the various statistical challenges laid out like this is that sometimes they arise not just because LLMs are too complex for us to understand, but also because they are proprietary objects.”\n\n\nThe frustration with most modern published LLM papers is industrial closedness reduces open research to ephemeral flailing. If you are taking a proprietary, closed model and doing some prompt engineering to elicit funny answers, you are doing HCI research on proprietary software. If you train a transformer model from scratch on the orbits of planets and don’t use all of the language on the internet, your result says nothing about LLMs. Even if you are fine-tuning an open weights model, there’s only so much we can learn because you have no idea what the training corpus is.\n\nMachine learning has thrived in its embrace of frictionless reproducibility— Open, shareable data. The ability to re-execute code. Competitive Testing. These are powerful tools to mitigate uncertainty. I’ve written some thoughts about why this is, drawing analogies to distributed optimization. I still think this is an excellent direction for meta-scientific study. But for whatever reason, many in the orbit of machine learning seem more interested in developing more statistical tests than in understanding why exactly this practice works so well.\n\nLet me close with quoting Andrew Gelman, who replied to Jessica,\n\n\n  “On the other side, Recht presents a very reasonable engineering perspective that is anti-bureaucratic: we’ve already made a lot of progress and continue to do so, so don’t tell us what to do. Or, to put it more carefully, you can tell us what to do for safety or public policy reasons, but it seems like a mistake to try to restrict researchers’ freedom in the belief that this will improve research progress. This general position makes sense to me, and it is similar to many things I’ve said and written regarding science reform: I don’t want to tell people what to do, and I also don’t want criticism to be suppressed. That doesn’t mean that science-reform proposals are necessarily bad. For example, I find preregistration to be valuable (for the science, not the p-values), but I wouldn’t want it to be a requirement.”\n\n\nI agree strongly here with Andrew. Our mandates should be few and far between. I advocate for only one: stronger norms about openness in code, data, and models.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nI’ll leave the Bayesians alone today because no one is yet proposing LDA to be on the NeurIPS checklist yet.\n\n2\n\nThough the train test paradigm was invented by practice, not by a careful application of statistics.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

Two fundamental questions persist: what\naccounts for the algorithm’s strong empirical performance, and can a tight\nbound on its iteration count be established?\nFor an $n\\times n$ matrix, its normalized version is obtained by dividing\neach entry by its largest entry. We say that a normalized matrix has a density\n$\\gamma$ if there exists a constant $\\rho &gt; 0$ such that one row or column has\nexactly $\\lceil \\gamma n \\rceil$ entries with values at least $\\rho$, and every\nother row and column has at least $\\lceil \\gamma n \\rceil$ such entries.\nFor the upper bound, we show that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm produces a\nnearly doubly stochastic matrix in $O(\\log n - \\log \\varepsilon)$ iterations\nand $\\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time for all nonnegative square matrices whose\nnormalized version has a density $\\gamma &gt; 1/2$.

For instance, it is more cost-effective to\ndeliver parcels with a single truck over eight hours than to use two trucks for\nfour hours, as long as the time suffices. To model such scenarios, we introduce\nthe novel minimum peak cost flow over time problem, whose objective is to\nminimise the maximum cost at all points in time rather than minimising the\nintegral of costs. We focus on minimising peak costs of temporally repeated\nflows. These are desirable for practical applications due to their simple\nstructure. This yields the minimum-peak-cost Temporally Repeated flow problem\n(MPC-TRF).\nWe show that the simple structure of temporally repeated flows comes with the\ndrawback of arbitrarily bad approximation ratios compared to general flows over\ntime. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows the integral version of\nMPC-TRF is strongly NP-hard, even under strong restrictions. On the positive\nside, we identify two benign special cases: unit-cost series-parallel networks\nand networks with time horizon at least twice as long as the longest path in\nthe network (with respect to the transit time).

In this paper, we present some new results on $k$-gleeful numbers\nfor $k&gt;1$.\nFirst, we extend previous analytical work. For given values of $x$ and $k$,\nwe give explicit upper and lower bounds on the number of $k$-gleeful\nrepresentations of integers $n\\le x$.\nSecond, we describe and analyze two new, efficient parallel algorithms, one\ntheoretical and one practical, to generate all $k$-gleeful representations up\nto a bound $x$.\nThird, we study integers that are multiply gleeful, that is, integers with\nmore than one representation as a sum of powers of consecutive primes,\nincluding both the same or different values of $k$. We give a simple heuristic\nmodel for estimating the density of multiply-gleeful numbers, we present\nempirical data in support of our heuristics, and offer some new conjectures.\n\nRead original post\n"

When $r=1$ this is the\nwell-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work\n\\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and\ndeveloped bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms\nfor the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.\nThese are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting\nproblems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at\nleast $\\Omega(\\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In\nthis paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when\n$r$ is a \\emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering\nmultiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria\napproximation algorithm that for any given integer $\\alpha \\ge 1$ outputs a set\n$S$ such that $f_i(S) \\ge$ $(1-1/e^\\alpha -\\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \\in [r]$\nand $\\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \\le (1+\\epsilon)\\alpha \\cdot \\sf{OPT}$.

These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an\napproximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$.

      "content": "Authors: Evangelos Protopapas, Dimitrios M. Thilikos, Sebastian Wiederrecht\n\nWe introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical\nconcept of rooted minors in graphs. $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair\n$(G, \\chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly\nempty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the\nclassical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing\nthe removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models\nalgorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated\nvertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing\nseveral theorems characterizing $\\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where\n$\\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned\nall colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face.\nLeveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -\nparameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit\nthe Erd\\H{o}s-P'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the\nalgorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful\nminor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with\nthe fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this\nimplies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits\na fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic\nmeta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of\ntreewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known\nAMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph\nbut also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.\n\nRead original post\n"

The title says it all. This paper gives a 0.51-approximation for the maximum matching in, well, (O(n^{1.5})) time. Here’s the back story. There are two kinds of sublinear maximum matching algorithms. The first kind (achieved after a long line of impressive results) get ((1- \\varepsilon))-approximations in time (O(n^{2 – \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}(1)})). This means that that in sublinear (o(n^2)) time, one can get arbitrarily good approximations. The second kind beats the simple (0.5)-approximation (obtained from maximal matchings), but tries for closer to (O(n)) time. Behnezhad–Roghani–Rubinstein–Saberi gave a ((0.5+\\varepsilon))-approximation algorithm running in (n^{1+\\varepsilon}) time. But the largest value of (\\varepsilon) possible in these results is tiny. Can one get a “significant” improvement over 0.5-approximations in time “significantly less” than (n^2)?

Consider a distribution over pairs ((A, B)). The mutual information (I(A,B)) of (A) and (B) is the minimum KL-divergence between the original distribution and any product distribution over the support of (A) and (B). So the mutual information is zero iff ((A,B)) is a product distribution, or equivalently (A) and (B) are independent. A natural distribution testing question is to distinguish (A) and (B) being independent from (I(A,B) &gt; \\varepsilon). One can take this problem a step further. Suppose the distribution is over triples ((A,B,C)). Then can one distinguish conditional independence ((I(A, B\n      C) = 0)) from sufficient conditional dependence, so (I(A, B\n      C) &gt; \\varepsilon)? This problem was studied by (including our very own) Canonne-Diakonikolas-Kane-Stewart, and is known that (O(d^{7/4})) samples suffice. Here, (d) denotes the maximum alphabet size for each coordinate, so the overall domain size is (d^3). This paper gives a much more nuanced complexity, that depends separately on the support sizes for each coordinate. It is interesting that each coordinate plays a different role in the final complexity.\n    \n  \n\n\nTight simulation of a distribution using conditional samples by Tomer Adar (arXiv). Consider a distribution of ({0,1}^n). Many distribution testing results would not yield useful algorithms for this setting, since the domain is exponentially large. Inspired by this setting, the subcube conditional model was introduced by Bhattacharyya-Chakraborty. In this setting, we can generate samples conditioned on any subcube. The aim of this paper goes beyond property testing. Can we actually estimate specific values of the distribution with a few queries? Can we simulate the distribution, which means to “locally compute” a distribution that is close to the input? Specifically, given domain point (x), we want to compute a value (\\mu(x)) such that (\\mu) represents a distribution close to the input. This paper gives such a result, where each (\\mu(x)) can be computed in (O(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)) queries. The final distribution has KL-divergence (\\varepsilon^2) from the original.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Sampling and Identity-Testing Without Approximate Tensorization of Entropy by William Gay, William He, Nicholas Kocurek, and Ryan O’Donnell (arXiv). Again, consider a distribution (D) over a large product domain (\\Sigma^n). Our aim is identity testing, so we wish to determine if ({D} = {D}’) or (\n      {D} – {D}’\n      &gt; \\varepsilon), where ({D}’) is some explicitly known distribution. The model is much weaker than subcube condition access. Essentially, we can only get samples from subcubes of dimension (at least) (n-1). Blanca-Chen-Štefankovič-Vigoda studied identity testing where ({D}) satisfies a condition called “approximate tensorization of entropy” (ATE). By Jensen’s inequality, if ({D}) is a product distribution, the entropy of ({D}) is at most the sum of entropies of the marginal distributions. If the entropy of ({D}) is (say) at most a constant factor of this sum, we say it satisfies the ATE. Blanca-Chen-Štefankovič-Vigoda proves that (\\widetilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon)) suffices for identity testing. This paper studies input distributions that are mixtures of (say, a constant number of) distributions satisfying ATE. Interestingly, these mixtures do not satisfy the ATE. But this paper shows that one can still get (\\widetilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon)) query identity testers.\n    \n  \n\n\nBy Seshadhri\n\nRead original post\n"

Many\nof the data problems, such as creating compact data summaries for approximate\nquery processing, can be effectively tackled using concepts from computational\ngeometry, such as $\\varepsilon$-nets. However, these powerful tools have yet to\nbe examined from the perspective of fairness. To fill this research gap, we add\nfairness to classical geometric approximation problems of $\\varepsilon$-net,\n$\\varepsilon$-sample, and geometric hitting set. We introduce and address two\nnotions of group fairness: demographic parity, which requires preserving group\nproportions from the input distribution, and custom-ratios fairness, which\ndemands satisfying arbitrary target ratios. We develop two algorithms to\nenforce fairness: one based on sampling and another on discrepancy theory. The\nsampling-based algorithm is faster and computes a fair $\\varepsilon$-net of\nsize which is only larger by a $\\log(k)$ factor compared to the standard\n(unfair) $\\varepsilon$-net, where $k$ is the number of demographic groups. The\ndiscrepancy-based algorithm is slightly slower (for bounded VC dimension), but\nit computes a smaller fair $\\varepsilon$-net. Notably, we reduce the fair\ngeometric hitting set problem to finding fair $\\varepsilon$-nets. This results\nin a $O(\\log \\mathsf{OPT} \\times \\log k)$ approximation of a fair geometric\nhitting set. Additionally, we show that under certain input distributions,\nconstructing fair $\\varepsilon$-samples can be infeasible, highlighting\nlimitations in fair sampling.

In the core\nof our approach is a polynomial time algorithm for computing planar\nH-modulators. Given a graph class H, a planar H-modulator of a graph G is a set\nX \\subseteq V(G) such that the ``torso’’ of X is planar and all connected\ncomponents of G - X belong to H. Here, the torso of X is obtained from G[X] if,\nfor every connected component of G-X, we form a clique out of its neighborhood\non G[X]. We introduce H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G\nhas a planar H-modulator. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable,\nand decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial\ntime. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by\ndefining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which\ngeneralize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the\nclass H. Combining this result with existing FPT algorithms for various\nH-modulator problems, we thereby obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by\nH-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth for numerous graph classes H. By\ncombining the well-known algorithmic properties of planar graphs and graphs of\nbounded treewidth, our methods for computing H-planar treedepth and H-planar\ntreewidth lead to a variety of algorithmic applications. For instance, once we\nknow that a given graph has bounded H-planar treedepth or bounded H-planar\ntreewidth, we can derive additive approximation algorithms for graph coloring\nand polynomial-time algorithms for counting (weighted) perfect matchings.\nFurthermore, we design Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes\n(EPTAS-es) for several problems, including Maximum Independent Set.\n\nRead original post\n"

For some reason Mr. Franklin never showed up to defend the old name.\n\nCornell still has a Lincoln Hall named after the former president.\n\nBILL: Does any campus name buildings to honor people anymore?\n\nLANCE: At this point I wouldn’t be surprised if some university names a building “Donald J Trump Hall” as part of a settlement.\n\nBut really, these days, you need money to build buildings, so they get named after donors—or after someone the donor wants to honor. Even if a building is built on state funds, it’s usually given a generic name to leave open a naming opportunity later.\n\nBILL: What happens if you name a building after someone because they gave money but later if they found out that they are an X (you can fill it in with some type of person you would not want to honor)? If you had named the building to honor them, you can change the name. If you named it because they gave money you may have a contractual obligation to keep the name. (This was almost a problem with Enron Field, see here).\n\nLANCE: In 2017, Yale renamed Calhoun College, named for a white supremacist, to honor Grace Murray Hopper.\n\nBILL: I hope they got all the bugs out first.\n\nI conjecture very few (any?) colleges name buildings anymore to honor people. It is purely transactional.\n\n1) Am I right?\n\n2) If so, is this a bad thing?\n\n3) And when will Grace Murray Hopper College be renamed again after a donor?\n\nBy gasarch\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Inductive inference, introduced by Solomonoff (Information and Control, 1964), is a foundational concept in knowledge acquisition, formulated as the task of extrapolating a sequence of symbols. In his seminal work, Solomonoff established a fundamental theorem for recursion-theoretic universal inductive inference, applicable to sequences generated by all Turing machines, based on the (uncomputable) task of computing Kolmogorov complexity.\nIn this work, we present a complexity-theoretic counterpart to Solomonoff’s theorem: we construct an efficient universal inductive inference algorithm, applicable to sequences efficiently generated by all randomized Turing machines, assuming that time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity can be efficiently approximated. This assumption is known to follow from the average-csae easiness of NP. As corollaries, we obtain various worst-case learning algorithms, such as distributional learning and learning adaptively changing distributions, under the assumption that NP is easy on average.\nOur inductive inference algorithm and its analysis build on techniques developed in meta-complexity theory. At a high level, the algorithm divides a given sequence of symbols into two parts, “advice” and “context”, and extrapolates the next symbol of the context according to the time-bounded universal distribution given the advice. We prove that this algorithm avoids computationally deep strings, which are hard instances for every average-case algorithm.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "url": "/cstheoryrss/2025/07/11/ben-recht-are-developers-finally-out-of-a-job/",
      "content": "\n\nYesterday, METR, one of the many budding nonprofit “AI Safety” institutes in Berkeley, released a study purportedly showing that AI tools slowed down expert developers. Here’s the plot they led with in their announcement:\n\n\n\nBecause METR, like all AI Safety Institutes, is run by devout rationalists, the first four bars here are the values of predictions. Everyone asked said AI would speed up development time. The final bar is the observed result. Ackshually, AI slows down development time.\n\nThis result inevitably broke the internet. The reaction on Twitter was “Bro, that’s clearly wrong.” The reaction on Bluesky was “See, I told you so.” I didn’t check LinkedIn. I wonder if METR’s cross-posting was itself part of an ethnographic study of confirmation bias.\n\nOn Bluesky, Akhil Rao smartly pointed out that the error bar on the speedup is very close to zero and hence must be fragile. It’s a good rule of thumb. But he didn’t want to be “the seminar standard errors guy.”\n\nLong-time readers know that horrible standard errors guy is me. I was ranting about AI papers and error bars last week. I wrote a whole paper about inferential error bars being a silly exercise unless we are using them as part of a clear regulatory rulebook. And hey, if everyone is freaking out about a study “proving” something with frequentist statistics, I’m going to be the sicko who goes and reads the appendix. You will not be surprised that I think the error bars are made up, even if there’s some interesting ethnography we can take away from METR’s work here.\n\nHere’s a summary of how the study worked:\n\n\n  METR recruited 16 developers\n  All 16 brought approximately 16 coding tasks to the study that they wanted to complete.\n  METR assigned each task to one of two conditions at random. Condition 0 is “you can’t use AI.” Condition 1 is “you can use AI.”\n  The developers completed their tasks in whichever order they desired. METR recorded the completion time for each task\n\n\nFirst, I don’t like calling this study an “RCT.” There is no control group! There are 16 people and they receive both treatments. We’re supposed to believe that the “treated units” here are the coding assignments. We’ll see in a second that this characterization isn’t so simple.\n\nAs experimenters, our goal is to figure out how the times in Condition 0 compare to those in Condition 1. There are a couple of ways to think about how to study this. If I were to take my guide from the “potential outcomes” school, I’d say something like the following.\n\nThere is an intrinsic amount of time each task takes in each condition. Unfortunately, I can only see one condition for each task. I can’t complete the tasks both with AI and without AI. I thus have a missing data problem. I can only see half of the times I care about in each condition. Perhaps I can use some clever math to estimate the actual average time in each condition had I seen everything. And I can use even more clever math to estimate the uncertainty in my estimate. You know, error bars.\n\nThis isn’t that crazy if you can sample uniformly at random. Let’s say you have a bunch of playing cards face down on the table in front of you. You want to estimate the proportion of the cards that are red. If you flip half of them uniformly at random, the proportion of red cards in your sample is a reasonable estimate of the proportion of red cars in the sample you didn’t see.\n\nThe problem in this study is that there are a bunch of steps required to go from randomizing the tasks to completing the tasks that cloud the estimation problem. These intermediary steps bias your estimation problem. The developers get to choose the order in which they complete the tasks. Task completion order can affect the amount of time it takes you to complete the task. For instance, if you’re an expert developer and asked to use a new tool, you’ll become faster with it after using it 8 times. Similarly, you can imagine that if you do a bunch of tasks in sequence, your time on task 4 is going to be sluggish because you are tired. There are lots of stories I can tell. There are undoubtedly many conditions that affect the time measurement other than their random assignment.\n\nThese other effects are called spillover or interference effects. In randomized trials, experimentalists work their tails off to remove these effects to ensure they are isolating the effect of the intervention. The ideal experiment satisfies SUTVA, the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption, which asserts that the only thing that affects a measured outcome is the assignment to the treatment group or the control group. This is a rather strong modeling assumption, but you perhaps could convince yourself that it is close to true in a carefully controlled, blinded study comparing a drug to a placebo.\n\nUnfortunately, SUTVA does not hold in the METR study. And that means we have to bring out the econometrics to tell the difference between the groups. Here’s where we get to wrestle in the mud with statistics. If you go to the appendix of the paper, you can bore yourself to death with regression models and robustness checks. The main model that they use to make the widely circulated plot (from Appendix D on page 27) is this one:\n\n\n\nThis model more or less says the following: each developer estimates how long a task will take. The median time for each task without AI is a constant times this estimate. The median time with AI is a different constant times the developer estimate. The observed time is the predicted time multiplied by the speedup time for the condition, multiplied by a fudge factor, which is a random variable. The fudge factor is independent of the AI condition, the person’s time estimate, and all of the other fudge factors. The expected value of the fudge factor is one for all tasks. The variance of the fudge factor is the same for all tasks.\n\nThat is, if you’d prefer something that looks like code,\n\ntime(task) = speedup(AI_condition) * est_time(task) * fudge_factor(task)\n\n\nIs that a reasonable model? The AI condition was assigned at random, so it should be independent of the estimated time. But the model assumes everyone experiences the same speed-up/slow-down with the AI tools. Since the fudge factor now includes the developers’ choices for the order in which they perform the tasks, they can’t be probabilistically independent.\n\nOK, so the model is not literally true, but perhaps you can convince me that it’s predictive? All models are wrong, amirite? The authors will now provide a bunch of “robustness checks” to convince you that it is close enough. Now we’re spending pages analyzing normal approximations when maybe we should accept that a precise estimate of “speedup” is impossible to measure with this experiment’s design.\n\nAfter thinking about this for a day, the only data summary I’m happy with would be the following simple analysis: “there are 256 coding tasks, each has an intrinsic time inside of it, when we flip coins we get to see 128 of the times in Condition 1 and 128 of the times in Condition 2. Here are the means and standard deviations of these times.” We could then all move on. I mean, rather than boring us with these robustness checks, METR could just release a CSV with three columns (developer ID, task condition, time). Then the seminar guys can run whatever dumb check they want.1\n\nLet me be clear here, I don’t think METR’s analysis is better or worse than any random quantitative social science study. Measurement in quantitative social sciences is always fraught with an infinite regress of doubt. That doesn’t mean we can’t tell reasonable qualitative stories with quantitative data. What we can glean from this study is that even expert developers aren’t great at predicting how long tasks will take. And despite the new coding tools being incredibly useful, people are certainly far too optimistic about the dramatic gains in productivity they will bring.\n\nThanks to ‪Sam Anthony, Tilman Bayer‬, ‪Isaiah Bishop‬, ‪Robin Blythe‬, Kevin Chen, ‪Greg Faletto, Apoorva Lal‬, Jordan Nafa, Akhil Rao, Anton Strezhnev, and Stephen Wild for hashing these thoughts out on Bluesky last night.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nMETR, if you are reading this, please do it.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

Jansen, Victor Lagerkvist, Magnus Wahlström\n\nIn the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), a clause is called\nredundant if its satisfaction is implied by satisfying all other clauses. An\ninstance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any\nredundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum\nnumber of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the\nnumber of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is\ncrucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and\nmathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity,\nuniversal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a\nnexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is\nto more deeply understand non-redundancy.\nOur first main result shows that for every rational number $r \\ge 1$, there\nexists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is\n$\\Theta(n^r)$.

We\ncompletely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates\n(i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy\nproblems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.\nInspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP\n2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an\napplication of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal’tsev\nembeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing\nthat a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first\nexample of predicate with a Mal’tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the\nstructure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli\ngroup.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "url": "/cstheoryrss/2025/07/10/ben-recht-an-open-mindset/",
      "content": "\n\nOver the 4th of July weekend, Nathan Lambert wrote a thoughtful post on “an American Deepseek Project,” posing the challenge of building a fully open, fully performant “frontier model” in the next two years. Deepseek, in case you’ve already forgotten, is a Chinese company that released a highly performing, open-source large language model chatbot in January that could be trained from scratch for under 10 million dollars. Nathan challenges the US research community to produce a similar open artifact.\n\nNathan’s post reminded me of what happened the last time we were told that you needed to be a hyperscaling tech company to do machine learning. In 2014, a year after paying 44 million dollars for Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoff Hinton, Google won the ILSVRC competition with their “GoogLeNet” model, achieving 93% top-5 accuracy.1 While the authors didn’t release the full details of how to train this model, they asserted they used Google’s internal DistBelief system, a distributed computing framework for wrangling thousands of Google CPUs. However, based on a back of the envelope calculation, they claimed “ the GoogLeNet network could be trained to convergence using few high-end GPUs within a week, the main limitation being the memory usage.”\n\nShortly thereafter, a team at Berkeley sort of reproduced this result, showing that half a day with 128 GPUs could get to 88% top-5 accuracy with the GoogLeNet architecture. I imagine they could have reached 93% had they run for longer. A supercomputer with 128 GPUs was still a serious investment for any academic team, and openly trained ImageNet models still seemed to require infrastructural investments outside the reach of most labs.\n\nIn 2015, a team of researchers at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing won the ILSVRC competition with their architecture called the ResNet. ResNets were interesting because the principles of architecture were easier to understand. The repeated layers in ResNets made it easy to explore and reimplement the architecture.\n\nSoon thereafter, the Dawn project at Stanford opened a competition, called DawnBench, to see who could train ResNets the fastest. In November 2017, their baseline entry used 8 GPUs for 10.5 days to train a ResNet ImageNet classifier with 93% top-5 accuracy. This cost $1100 using Amazon cloud services. Already, this was getting somewhere, but I don’t think the Dawn team anticipated how quickly competition progress would come. By April 2018, that is, in less than six months, competitors had the training time down to 30 minutes on a single TPU core on Google Cloud. That’s nearly a 500x acceleration in 6 months, and a dramatic cost reduction.\n\nI tell this story because I’m optimistic that Nathan’s challenge is feasible. For two decades, Google and its peers have argued that you need scale to do anything. These claims are marketing. They have been proven wrong several times,2 but it required a significant community commitment to do it. What are those commitments for Nathan’s Deepseek Project?\n\nFirst, it’s elevating old school computational evaluations. During the initial deep learning boom, the machine learning research community decided that worthy common tasks were training time and model accessibility. These evaluations have been missing from the latest “frontier models” arms race. It’s also understandable that the computing for “frontier models” is much larger than it was for ImageNet. The hyperscalers’ only advantage is to find a starting point that’s inaccessible to a researcher without an infinite cloud computing budget. The 6 million dollars needed to train DeepSeek is out of reach for almost any machine learning researcher. This means that the initial work on any fully open LLM will require large-scale collaboration or perhaps an industrial benefactor. On the other hand, a 500x improvement in training time gets these models down to costing under twenty thousand dollars, which is the sort of thing you can add as a line item in a grant proposal.\n\nMore importantly, I want to emphasize that Nathan’s challenge is for something greater than just GPU golf. When he writes “open model,” he really means open. The Deepseek model is “open weights,” which means you can run and tweak it, but you can’t build it from scratch. This is similar to the openness of Meta’s Llama models. Nathan’s vision calls for open data, training code, logs, and decision making too.\n\nI will never get over how the entire machine learning community is writing papers about systems where they don’t know what the training data is. Yes, the artifacts are interesting, but no, we’re not going to learn anything by fine-tuning RL models on top and running hackneyed 1960s psychology experiments on computers. Certainly, open weight models are preferable to closed weight models. But we shouldn’t have to settle.\n\nOpen data poses its own challenges to our community. Though we generally concede that open data has been the primary means of driving machine learning research, parts of the research community are openly hostile to open data. And it’s not exactly who you’d think it would be. Some of the biggest “success stories” of the responsible AI/fairness community are based on finding “dangerous” content in open data sets, resulting in these data sets being removed from the public domain. The Netflix Prize, Tiny Images Dataset, and yes, even ImageNet, have all been either entirely removed, taken down for extended periods, or neutered in some capacity because of highly questionable arguments about “responsibility.”\n\nThis push towards prioritizing academic notions of “privacy,” “safety,” and “fairness” over all else has mostly resulted in academic censorship. And yet, while the hyperscalers love to pay lip service to responsible behavior, they don’t stop using this data! Recent lawsuits have revealed that Anthropic scans millions of books and Facebook trains on LibGen. But academic researchers aren’t allowed to use the Tiny Images Dataset. The hyperscalers do whatever they want, in private, locking out competition and strengthening their oligopoly. They know they will find a favorable ruling in Bill Alsup’s court because they have infinite money for their legal teams.\n\nSo while it’s undeniably essential to raise issues about the societal impacts of machine learning technology, we have to be careful not to do this in a way that solidifies corporate power. If we want fully open and accessible machine learning models, we need to figure out how to build them while accepting that the internet on which they are trained is littered with endlessly horrific and dangerous content. Nathan’s challenge is thus asking the open research community to engage with uncomfortable trade-offs about what open means. This question is as vital as shaking the can to raise money for NVIDIA chips.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nFor the purposes of this blog post “top-5 accuracy” is just a number between 0 and 100. Higher is better. Don’t sweat the details of what this means or actually evaluates.\n\n2\n\nNaomi Saphra points me to another example in machine translation.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

Inspired by tree codes (Schulman, STOC’93), we propose tree PCPs; these are PCPs that evolve as the computation progresses so that a proof for time $t$ is obtained by appending a short string to the end of the proof for time $t-1$. At any given time, the tree PCP can be locally queried to verify the entire computation so far.\nWe construct tree PCPs for non-deterministic space-$s$ computation, where at time step $t$, the proof only grows by an additional $poly(s,\\log(t))$ bits, and the number of queries made by the verifier to the overall proof is $poly(s) \\cdot t^\\epsilon$, for an arbitrary constant $\\epsilon &gt; 0$.\nTree PCPs are well-suited to proving correctness of ongoing computation that unfolds over time. They may be thought of as an information-theoretic analog of the cryptographic notion of incrementally verifiable computation (Valiant, TCC’08). In the random oracle model, tree PCPs can be compiled to realize a variant of incrementally verifiable computation where the prover is allowed a small number of queries to a large evolving state. This yields the first construction of (a natural variant of) IVC in the random oracle model.\n\nRead original post\n"

While Fiat-Shamir heuristic can be used to eliminate the need for actual interaction, in modern highly-parallelizable computer architectures such as GPUs, the large number of rounds still translates into a major bottleneck for the prover, since it needs to alternate between computing the IOP messages and the Fiat-Shamir hashes. Motivated by this fact, in this work we study the round complexity of linear-prover IOPs.\nOur main result is an IOP for a large class of Boolean circuits, with only $O(\\log^*(S))$ rounds, where $\\log^*$ denotes the iterated logarithm function (and $S$ is the circuit size). The prover has linear size $O(S)$ and the verifier runs in time $\\mathrm{polylog}(S)$ and has query complexity $O(\\log^*(S))$.

Additionally, we leverage\nclassical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase\ntransitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region\nsize increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between\ntrainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren\nplateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to\nexist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm\nin practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone’’\nwhere gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to\npractically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for\nquantum advantage.\n\nRead original post\n"

The Chain Rule for conditional $K^t$ with error $e$ is the following hypothesis: there is a constant $c\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that, for any strings $y,x_1,\\dots,x_{\\ell}\\in{0,1}^*$, for any $\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and all sufficiently large time bounds $t$,\n[\nK^t(x_1,\\dots,x_{\\ell}\\mid y) \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} K^{t^{c}}(x_i \\mid y, x_1,\\dots,x_{i-1}) - \\ell\\cdot O(\\log t) -e(N,t),\n]\nwhere $N=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} |x_i|$.\nWe pinpoint the complexity assumptions equivalent to Chain Rules for conditional $K^t$, and the probabilistic variant $pK^t$, where $pK^t(x\\mid y)\\leq s$ iff $K^t(x\\mid y,r)\\leq s$ for at least $2/3$ of random strings $r\\in{0,1}^t$.\n\n  Chain Rule for conditional $K^t$ with error $e(N,t)\\leq o(N)$ is equivalent to the conjunction of the following two statements:\n(a) $E\\not\\subset io SIZE[2^{o(n)}]$, and\n(b) $Gap McK^tP\\in promise\\text{-} P$, where $Gap McK^tP$ is a promise problem to distinguish between inputs $(x,y,1^s)$ with $K^t(x\\mid y)\\leq s$ and those with $K^{poly(t)}(x\\mid y)&gt; s + o(|x|)$.\n  Chain Rule for conditional $pK^t$ with error $e(N,t)\\leq o(N)$ is equivalent to $Gap McpK^tP\\in promise\\text{-} BPP$, for the analog of $Gap McK^tP$ for conditional $pK^t$.\nThese are the first exact complexity characterizations for natural versions of Chain Rules for time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.\nAssuming $Gap McK^tP$ is $NP$-hard (which is true under cryptographic assumptions [Huang et al., STOC’23]), the equivalence above would simplify to ``the Chain Rule for conditional $K^t$ with error $e(N,t)\\leq o(N)$ holds iff $NP=P$’’. That is, under a plausible $NP$-hardness assumption for $Gap McK^tP$, we would get that proving $P\\neq NP$ is equivalent to disproving the Chain Rule for conditional $K^t$.\nAmong other results, we present a natural $promise\\text{-} BPP$-complete problem based on the problem of approximating $pK^t(x\\mid y)$ for short inputs $x$ with $|x|\\leq \\log t$, and give some algorithmic consequences if $Gap McpK^TP$ were easy.\n\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "I had an epiphany reading an article in the Trenton Times when I lived in New Jersey at the turn of the century. The article interviewed companies along a certain street lobbying for a new bus route so their employees could more easily get to work. The customers for mass transit are not its riders but the employers who need workers to get to them. Maybe that’s why mass transit trains and buses offer a functional but not particularly comfortable ride.\n\nSo who are the customers for universities? Before I go there, let’s look at newspapers. Until the early 2000s, newspapers were primarily driven by advertising revenue. Readers were the product. While newspapers needed readers to sell, they could get them by offering cheap subscriptions by focusing on quality coverage that focused on news and analysis from a broad range of views. But since then, the few newspapers that thrive now do so mostly on subscription revenue, print and digital, and the readers have become the customers. They also have more competition from other sources like social media. So newspapers now tailor their coverage and their brand for the paying subscriber, and while most still focus on accuracy, they’ll stick to narrower views in their analysis which often overshadows the pure news.\n\nUniversities have a mission beyond just serving students, providing them with knowledge in exchange for tuition. They have a societal mission. The Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862, which helped establish and grow a number of public universities, wanted to educate students to improve the productivity of American agriculture and industry. The GI Bill in 1944 brought the masses of returning soldiers into higher education. The Higher Education Act of 1965, brought in resources for students through Pell Grants and federally-guaranteed student Loans to further the competitiveness of America through the Cold War. Most universities have non-profit status because of their broader mission.\n\nIn other words, society as a whole was our customer. Our role is to educate and prepare students to help push our society forward. Many universities also have a research mission, also mostly government funded, both to recruit expert professors to educate our students, but also to produce important knowledge to manage the complexities of the world. Students participated willingly for future intellectual and financial gain and our role was to ensure the students got a strong education, for the betterment of not just themselves but the workforce and society they would later join.\n\nOur viewpoint has changed as college costs increased and universities became more dependent on tuition and governmental financial aid. Institutions started treating the students as the customer, to ensure they came to the university and stayed there. More amenities, grade inflation, much more student support and tolerance. The relationship became transactional, a student comes, pays their tuition and their time, gets a degree and gets a job. The focus becomes more on degrees that prepare you for the workplace, a focus more on immediate skill and credential building than producing students who have the critical thinking skills to build a strong career.\n\nAnd now in a time of changing demographics, less government support and AI heading towards performing many of the skills universities teach, how does the story continue? How do universities focus back on producing students who can not just live in our society but improve it? How do they focus on the right customers while ensuring educational quality? Universities need to get it right, or they won’t have customers at all.\n\nBy Lance Fortnow\n\nRead original post\n"

The value of the function is $1$ iff there are at least $k$ $1$s among\nthe variables. The goal is to efficiently compute a strategy that, at minimum\nexpected cost, tests the variables until the function value is determined.\nWhile an elegant polynomial-time exact algorithm is known when tests can be\nmade adaptively, we focus on the non-adaptive variant, for which much less is\nknown.\nFirst, we show a clean and tight lower bound of $2$ on the adaptivity gap,\ni.e., the worst-case multiplicative loss in the objective function caused by\ndisallowing adaptivity, of the problem. This improves the tight lower bound of\n$3/2$ for the unit-cost variant.\nSecond, we give a PTAS for computing the best non-adaptive strategy in the\nunit-cost case, the first PTAS for an SBFE problem. At the core, our scheme\nestablishes a novel notion of two-sided dominance (w.r.t. the optimal solution)\nby guessing so-called milestone tests for a set of carefully chosen buckets of\ntests.

It is known that $\\Theta(d/\\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\\rho$ are\nnecessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled\nmeasurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for\na worst-case $\\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is\nfor this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal\nbounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the\ntester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],\nthey remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements\nthey can perform.\nWe address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for\nquantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled\nmeasurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal\ncopy complexity for certifying $\\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity\ntimes the fidelity between $\\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our\nlower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,\nwhich is likely to be of independent interest.

      "content": "How Intelligence Arises from Nature, One Layer at a Time\n\n\n\nThe Trouble with Definitions\n\n\n  “The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao.” — Lao Tzu\n\n\nAs a mathematician, I’ve long sought clean definitions. Much of my work involves building precise frameworks — starting by defining key concepts, isolating the core of a problem, formalizing it, and tracing its implications to their logical end.\n\nYet over time, I’ve come to see not just the limits of definitions, but their quiet distortions—the way they can flatten nuance in the name of clarity. The richness of a living idea gets traded for the sterile comfort of formal neatness. Sometimes, defining isn’t just clarifying — it’s an act of power: shaping perception, and granting authority to the one who defines.\n\nFew ideas reveal this tension more vividly than intelligence. We talk about it as if we know what it is — a score, a skill, a spark. But what is it, really? And can something so dynamic ever be pinned down?\n\nI think of intelligence not as a fixed trait, but as an experience — not unlike beauty — arising in context, felt through interaction.\n\nSo while we try to define intelligence — because we must — to witness it, to live with it, or to build systems that move with it, we need something else: humility. An attention to context. A willingness to recognize that intelligence, like beauty, is often messy, partial, plural, heuristic, and still astonishingly effective.\n\nBut even our capacity to see intelligence is shaped by history. In The Myth of Superintelligence, I argued that our attempts to define intelligence are never neutral. They reflect what we choose to measure, optimize, and reward. This essay is not a repetition of that critique. It is a step back. A shift in lens. It asks not what intelligence is, but when and how it arises—not as a trait, but as something unfolding across time, scale, and structure.\n\nBecause the power to define has always been the power to exclude. Colonial systems didn’t just extract labor and land—they imposed ways of seeing. In doing so, they dismissed the intelligence embedded in other ways of knowing, reframing rich knowledge traditions as myth or superstition. These distortions still echo in how we define and measure intelligence today. African polyrhythms were labeled primitive. Classical Indian music was exoticized or ignored. Indigenous knowledge systems—deeply attuned to land, season, and cycle—were reduced to folklore. Intelligence was there. But the lens refused to see it.\n\nThis is why any inquiry into intelligence must also be an inquiry into perspective. Definitions don’t just clarify. They constrain. They shape not only what we see, but what we believe intelligence can be.\n\nThis series is an attempt to widen the lens—to trace intelligence not as a fixed trait, but as a dynamic unfolding across layers of complexity. We begin with the silent elegance of physical systems, where matter flows under law, solving problems through coherence and constraint. From there, we enter the domain of evolution, where life adapts through variation and feedback, accumulating structure over time. We then move to the responsive intelligence of behavior—organisms without minds that nonetheless solve, coordinate, and learn through interaction.\n\nBut these are just the foundations. In the second half, we abstract upward: tracing how intelligence evolves the ability to frame problems, to reflect on and revise its own rules, and finally, to orient itself—to choose what matters. This is where intelligence becomes recursive, contextual, and ultimately, meaningful. Not just a solver of problems, but a seeker of value.\n\nRead the full essay by subscribing (for free) toThe Intelligence Loop.\n\nBy nisheethvishnoi\n\nRead original post\n"

We seek\na minimum-cost subset $H \\subseteq E$ such that each $s_i$-$t_i$ pair remains\nconnected even if any $r_i-1$ edges fail. It is well-known that SNDP can be\nequivalently modeled using a weakly-supermodular \\emph{cut-requirement\nfunction} $f$, where we seek a minimum-cost edge-set containing at least $f(S)$\nedges across every cut $S \\subseteq V$.\nRecently, Dinitz et al. proposed a variant of SNDP that enforces a\n\\emph{relative} level of fault tolerance with respect to $G$, where the goal is\nto find a solution $H$ that is at least as fault-tolerant as $G$ itself. They\nformalize this in terms of paths and fault-sets, which gives rise to\n\\emph{path-relative SNDP}. Along these lines, we introduce a new model of\nrelative network design, called \\emph{cut-relative SNDP} (CR-SNDP), where the\ngoal is to select a minimum-cost subset of edges that satisfies the given\n(weakly-supermodular) cut-requirement function to the maximum extent possible,\ni.e., by picking $\\min{f(S),|\\delta_G(S)|}$ edges across every cut\n$S\\subseteq V$.\nUnlike SNDP, the cut-relative and path-relative versions of SNDP are not\nequivalent. The resulting cut-requirement function for CR-SNDP (as also\npath-relative SNDP) is not weakly supermodular, and extreme-point solutions to\nthe natural LP-relaxation need not correspond to a laminar family of tight cut\nconstraints. Consequently, standard techniques cannot be used directly to\ndesign approximation algorithms for this problem. We develop a \\emph{novel\ndecomposition technique} to circumvent this difficulty and use it to give a\n\\emph{tight $2$-approximation algorithm for CR-SNDP}. We also show new hardness\nresults for these relative-SNDP problems.\n\nRead original post\n"

In\nthis paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum\ncomputing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via\nquantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent\nregret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we\ndemonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a\nfactor of $(1+\\sqrt{B/\\mathrm{OPT}_\\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget\nconstraint in BwK and $\\mathrm{OPT}_{\\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of\na linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem.

Little\n\nWe introduce an efficient and elegant combination generator for producing all\ncombinations of size less than or equal to K, designed for exhaustive\ngeneration and combinatorial optimization tasks. This generator can be\nimplemented to achieve what we define as optimal efficiency: constant amortized\ntime, optimal cache utilization, embarrassingly parallel execution, and a\nrecursive structure compatible with pruning-based search. These properties are\ndifficult to satisfy simultaneously in existing generators. For example,\nclassical Gray code or lexicographic generators are typically list-based and\nsequentially defined, making them difficult to vectorized, inefficient in cache\nusage, and inherently hard to parallelize. Generators based on unranking\nmethods, while easy to parallelize, are non-recursive. These limitations reduce\ntheir applicability in our target applications, where both computational\nefficiency and recursion are crucial. We adapt Bird’s algebra of\nprogramming-style calculation to derive our algorithms, a formalism for\ndeveloping correct-by-construction programs from specifications. As a result,\nall generators in this paper are first formulated in their clearest\nspecification, and efficient definitions are derived constructively through\nequational reasoning, resulting in concise and elegant divide-and-conquer\ndefinitions. Beyond presenting a combination generator, we extend our approach\nto construct generators for K-permutations, nested combinations of\ncombinations, and nested permutation-combination structures. To the best of our\nknowledge, the literature has not previously reported generators for these\nnested structures. We also develop sequential variants that produce\nconfigurations in Gray code-compatible orders – such as the revolving door\nordering – which are particularly useful for constructing nested generators.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Beginning computer science students learn about stacks, queues, and priority queues, different ways of organizing and ordering a collection of tasks to be performed. But more basic than any of those, and less frequently taught and formalized, is the ready list, a collection of tasks to be performed whose ordering is not important. All it needs to do is to allow new tasks to be added to the collection and to find and remove an arbitrary task from the collection.\n\nStandard algorithms that work with ready lists include:\n\n\n  Reachability\n  Input: a directed or undirected graph and a starting vertex in the graph\n  Output: the set of vertices that can be reached from the starting vertex\n  Algorithm:\n\n    \n      Initialize a set of reachable vertices, and a ready list of reachable but unprocessed vertices, both initially containing only the starting vertex.\n      While the ready list is non-empty:\n        \n          Find and remove a vertex (v) from the ready list\n          For each outgoing neighbor (w) of (v) that is not already in the reachable set, add (w) to both the reachable set and the ready list.\n        \n      \n      Return the reachable set\n    \n  \n  Topological ordering\n  Input: a directed acyclic graph\n  Output: a sequence of vertices, ordered so all edges go from earlier to later in the ordering\n  Algorithm:\n\n    \n      Initialize a ready list of vertices with no incoming edges\n      While the ready list is non-empty:\n        \n          Find and remove a vertex (v) from the ready list\n          Delete (v) from the graph and output (v)\n          Add to the ready list any former neighbor of (v) which, after the deletion, has no more incoming edges\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Stable matching\n  Input: A set of job applicants and a set of employers, with each applicant having a preference ordering among the employers and each employer having a preference ordering among the applicants\n  Output: A stable matching\n  Algorithm:\n\n    \n      Initialize a ready list of job offers from each employer to its top applicant\n      While the ready list is non-empty:\n        \n          Find and remove an offer from employer (X) to applicant (A)\n          If (A) prefers their current situation over (X), add to the ready list a new job offer from (X) to (X)’s next applicant.\n          Otherwise, match (A) and (X); if (A) was previously matched, remove that match and add to the ready list a new job offer from (A)’s previous employer to its next applicant\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the cases of reachability and stable matching, the ordering chosen by the ready list is unimportant: you will always get the same reachable set and the same matching. In the case of topological ordering, you may get different orderings but regardless of order you will always output the same set of vertices for any given graph, even if the graph is not acyclic.\n\nThis invariance is usually proven algorithm-by-algorithm, but it is true very generally for a class of algorithms with three simple properties: First, an item that is added to the ready list stays there until it is processed. Second, each item is added to the ready list only once. And third, the condition for adding an item to the ready list should be a monotonic combination of which other items have already been processed: if a certain combination of processed items triggers an addition, then any superset of the same combination should trigger the same addition. The trigger for reachability is that some neighbor is processed, and the trigger for topological ordering is that all incoming neighbors are processed. For stable matching, the trigger for an offer from (X) to (A) is that (X)’s previous applicant has already received both an offer from (X) and an offer from another employer that they prefer over (X).\n\nThese three properties are enough to prove that the sequences in which items can be processed by an algorithm of this type form an antimatroid. The key axiom of antimatroid sequences that we need to prove is that, if two sequences (S) and (T) can both be generated, and (S) contains an item not in (T), then (S) contains an item (x) that can be processed next after (T), producing a sequence (Tx). To prove this, simply let (x) be the first item that belongs to (S) but not (T), and apply the monotonic trigger property.\n\nIn any antimatroid, all sequences that cannot be extended consist of the same set of items. Again, this is easy to prove: if two sequences had different sets of items, then one would contain an item by which the other could be extended. To translate this into terms more familiar to the beginning computer science students: if a ready list obeys the three properties given above, and we run an algorithm using it until the ready list becomes empty, then all runs of the algorithm process the same set of items.\n\nWhile exploring this I ran into another basic algorithm that in its usual form is based on integer priority queues but can be transformed into a ready list algorithm:\n\n\n  Degeneracy\n  Input: An undirected graph\n  Output: A subgraph whose minimum degree is as large as possible\n  Algorithm:\n\n    \n      Initialize an empty ready list\n      While the graph is non-empty:\n        \n          If the ready list is empty, set (d) to the minimum degree in the graph, set (S) to be an empty set, and add to the ready list all vertices of degree (d)\n          Find and remove a vertex (v) from the ready list\n          Delete (v) from the graph and add (v) to (S)\n          Add to the ready list any former neighbors of (v) for which this removal decreases the degree to (\\le d)\n        \n      \n      Output the subgraph induced in the original input graph by (S)\n    \n  \n\n\nThis can be made to run in linear time but the details of that are beyond the scope of this post. Proving monotonicity of the condition for triggering addition to the ready list is a little less obvious here. For each integer (k) we can define a subgraph called the (k)-core, the union of all subgraphs whose minimum degree is at least (k). The output is the (d)-core. The monotonic trigger for any vertex (v) to be added to the ready list is that all vertices not in the (k)-core have already been processed, where (k) is the largest value for which the (k)-core contains (v), and that (v) has at most (k) unprocessed neighbors.\n\nAbstractly, the decreasing degrees of the vertices can be seen as a kind of element quality that decreases as other elements are removed; we seek the subset maximizing the minimum quality of any of its elements. My latest preprint, “Decremental greedy polygons and polyhedra without sharp angles” (arXiv:2507.04538, to appear at this year’s Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry) looks at a general class of problems like this, and identifies several more. One of the simplest of these is to find a polygon through a subset of the points that maximizes the minimum interior angle.\n\n\n\nSo here is the algorithm; I think the similarities between this and the degeneracy algorithms are obvious.\n\n\n  Max-min angle polygon\n  Input: A set of points in (\\mathbb{R}^2)\n  Output: A polygon with the points as vertices whose sharpest angle is as large as possible\n  Algorithm:\n\n    \n      Initialize an empty ready list\n      While the set of points is non-empty:\n        \n          If the ready list is empty, set (\\theta) to the minimum angle of a convex hull vertex of the remaining points, set (S) to be an empty set, and add to the ready list all convex hull vertices of angle (\\theta)\n          Find and remove a point (p) from the ready list\n          Delete (p) from the points and add (p) to (S)\n          Add to the ready list any convex hull vertices for which this removal decreases the angle to (\\le\\theta)\n        \n      \n      Output the convex hull of (S)\n    \n  \n\n\nThis can be made to run in time (O(n\\log n)); for details see the preprint. I’ll finish with one more from the full version of the paper, on cycles in directed graphs.\n\n\n  Bottleneck cycle\n  Input: A directed graph with weighted edges\n  Output: A cycle whose minimum edge weight is as large as possible\n  Algorithm:\n\n    \n      Initialize a ready list of the edges out of all vertices that have no incoming edges, and the edges into all vertices that have no outgoing edges\n      Initialize an empty set (S)\n      While the set of graph edges is non-empty:\n        \n          If the ready list is empty, set (w) to the minimum weight of a remaining edge, set (S) to be an empty set, and add to the ready list all edges of weight (w)\n          Find and remove an edge ((u,v)) from the ready list\n          Delete edge ((u,v)) from the graph and add it to (S)\n          If (u) has no more outgoing edges, add to the ready list all its incoming edges.\n          If (v) has no more incoming edges, add to the ready list all its outgoing edges.\n        \n      \n      Find and output any cycle in the subgraph of edges in (S)\n    \n  \n\n\nFor this one, a direct implementation on a graph with (n) vertices and (m) edges would take time (O(m\\log n)), not really better than the obvious binary search. However, it can be made to run in linear time for graphs with edges already sorted by length, and this presorted version can be used as a subroutine in a different algorithm for graphs with unsorted edges, in time (O(m\\log^* n)). In turn, bottleneck cycles can be used as a subroutine in an algorithm for finding the max-min angle closed polygonal curve for 3d points, allowing the curve to pass repeatedly through points and segments, in time (O(n^3\\log^* n)).

      "url": "/cstheoryrss/2025/07/07/ben-recht-you-keep-using-that-word/",
      "content": "\n\nA friend sent me a fun article in FT Alphaville by Bryce Elder showing how dogma doesn’t need to make sense to make money. The article hooked me from the get-go:\n\n\n  “The Virtue of Complexity in Return Prediction — co-authored by Bryan Kelly with Semyon Malamud and Kangying Zhou — found that complex machine-learning models were better than simple ones at predicting stock prices and building portfolios.”\n\n\n\n  “The finding was a big deal because it contradicted one of machine learning’s guiding principles, the bias-variance trade-off, which says the predictive power of models weakens as they grow beyond some optimum level. Given too many parameters to play with, a bot will tend to overfit its output to random noise in the training data.”\n\n\nOh, I’ve written about this before, arguing we should remove the bias-variance tradeoff from the machine learning curriculum. Much love to everyone who references the ye olde argmin blog in the comments over on Alphville. I appreciate the shoutouts! However, many of my friends in finance have told me that their data was where statistical overfitting, the type of overfitting we teach in our undergraduate classes, was a real phenomenon. Here is a paper that apparently refutes their claims. According to Kelly et al., even in finance, the bias-variance tradeoff isn’t real. Elder continues:\n\n\n  “The finding was rooted in an AI concept known as double descent, which says deep learning algorithms make fewer mistakes when they have more variable parameters than training data points.”\n\n\nDouble descent, you say? Hmm. At this point in the article, I got a bit worried because that’s… not what double descent says. Well, now I had to go and download the paper from SSRN. It checks in at a crisp 141 pages.\n\nOnce you skip past the laborious theoretical analysis of a linear Gaussian model, you get to the experiments on page 41. The authors want to predict next month’s prices from a set of 15 indicators. They use a window of past pairs of indicators and prices from the last 12 months to make this prediction. They propose applying standard supervised learning to solve this problem. Translating their setup into machine learning language: their training dataset has 12 examples, each with 15 features. Yes, 12.\n\nWhat do they conclude? They find that if they use random Fourier features, then the training error continues to decrease as they add more and more features. In particular, using 12,000 random Fourier features still gives good performance.\n\nOh my. I know it’s been twenty years since Ali and I first wrote up our paper on random features, and our point seems to have been lost in time.1 The motivation was finding computationally efficient ways to approximate machine learning in kernel spaces. I realize no one learns about kernel methods anymore, but you can read about them in Chapter 4 of Patterns, Predictions, and Actions. For the purpose of this post: kernel methods give you a computationally efficient way to compute a prediction model that uses an infinite number of features. Through some fun linear algebra, it turns out you only need to solve a linear system with one variable for every training example. Kernel methods transform infinite-dimensional learning problems into finite-dimensional linear algebra problems.\n\nStill, kernel methods require more computation than standard linear regression methods (and deep learning methods for that matter). The time needed to solve a linear system scales with the cube of the number of data points. The time required to solve linear regression scales linearly with the number of data points. Ali and I initially stumbled upon random features as a way to approximate kernel methods by solving linear regression problems.\n\nBut you know folks, kernel methods aren’t that computationally expensive. Cubic time is still polynomial time. And high-dimensional linear regression has its own scaling issues. The solution time of a random Fourier features problem scales with the square of the number of features.2 Since random features approximate kernel methods, the prediction performance of kernel methods should always be as good or better.3\n\nTo reiterate, kernel ridge regression solves an infinite-dimensional regression problem. It is going to get you the solution promised by the asymptote of that double descent curve you are all so enamored with. Infinity is more than 12,000, and moar is always better, right? If you find yourself using 1000 times more random features than data points, you might want to consider reading a few tutorials on kernel regression. It’s not hard to implement! In Python on my laptop, I can solve a 12 example kernel ridge regression problem in microseconds.\n\nThe argmin blog is here to help you save money on GPU cloud credits.\n\nNow you might ask, would “ridgeless kernel regression,” that is, kernel regression that ignores the warnings of the bias-variance tradeoff, work well for time series analysis? This is a good question, and one asked by Emmanuel Parzen in his landmark 1961 paper, “An Approach to Time Series Analysis.”4 Parzen’s paper is one of the first to explicitly use reproducing kernels in prediction problems. In Section 6, he proposes using ridgeless kernel regression to solve the exact same problem studied by Kelly and coauthors.\n\nI’m not the first person to recognize this, as Elder notes in Alphaville. Stefan Nagel wrote a convincing rebuttal to Kelly et al., posted last week. Nagel notes that random Fourier features are approximating kernel regression. He also notes that the prediction function computed by kernel regression looks a lot like kernel smoothing. This means the data points that most influence the prediction will be the ones most recent in time. Nagel thus argues that Kelly et al. are making a bunch of appeals to deep learning hype to reinvent momentum investing.\n\nAnd about that bias-variance tradeoff? If you slog through Kelly et al, you’ll see that their theoretical analysis has a bias-variance tradeoff! And the optimum setting requires tuning the tradeoff!\n\n\n  “We show that machine learning portfolios tend to incrementally benefit from moving away from the ridgeless limit by introducing nontrivial shrinkage.”\n\n\nSigh.\n\nI realize that everyone has jumped on the deep learning train now, but cargo culting isn’t in your interest. For small problems (like training sets of size 12), you don’t need neural networks. You can use them, I guess. But you can get more understanding out of these small, infinite-dimensional models that people have been studying for seventy years.\n\nSadly, the hype cycle gets everyone confused. It’s hilarious that stylized statistical learning theory stories now find their way into the mainstream press. The Alphaville title is even confused here: “Are bigger AI models better stock pickers? Maybe, but probably not. Complexity ain’t all that, wonks say.” I mean, this contradicts the rest of the story. First, calling ordinary least squares “AI” is a bit of a stretch. Second, Nagel’s results show that in this restricted class of models, bigger models are indeed better. Moreover, those infinitely large models recover well-known, naive momentum strategies.\n\nKelly and his fund, AQR, weren’t happy about Elder’s article. They wrote a rebuttal, proclaiming:\n\n\n  “The empirical dominance of large models has been shown in every area of ML by heavyweight ML academics’ research, which has been conducted throughout the natural and applied sciences. Language and image modeling are most well-known applications that exemplify the success of large models. Do we really think that finance, economics, or other social sciences are special? The work of Kelly and team shows otherwise.”\n\n\nThis heavyweight ML academic offers a very reasonable consulting fee if you are at a hedge fund and need assistance understanding double descent and the no true Scotsman fallacy.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\n…like tears in rain.\n\n2\n\nYeah, you can do some stochastic gradient stuff to get that square down to linear, but let me not bore everyone with flop counting. We can save that for a more technical post.\n\n3\n\nI realize theory and practice don’t always align, but in my experience, this is always true.\n\n4\n\nWhat a title. Such modesty with indefinite articles would get you immediately desk rejected at NeurIPS.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

Yuri fest took place in Munich and on Zoom between June 20–22 2025 and Shelah’s birthday conference will be held in Vienna on July 14–15, 2025.\n\n\n\nFor my general thoughts on celebrating colleagues’ birthdays in these tragic and dangerous times, see this post.\n\nSaharon Shelah is among the greatest and most decorated mathematicians of our time with groundbreaking contributions in model theory, set theory, combinatorics, and other areas. Among his most famous achievements are  the development of classification theory in model theory, his arithmetic cardinal theory (see this post), his proof that Whitehead’s conjecture is independent from ZFC, and his effective bounds for Van der Waerden numbers in combinatorics.\n\nYuri Gurevich is a renowned mathematical logician who transitioned to theoretical and practical computer science, software engineering, and later, quantum computing. One of the most natural average-case complete problems was introduced in a paper by Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich. (Andreas and Yuri have been long-time collaborators and friends.) Saharon and Yuri also coauthored a few important papers, including one on monadic second-order theories.\n\nI’ve known both Saharon and Yuri since the late 1970s. Over the years, I would occasionally visit Saharon’s office (and now that I think about it, I should have taken a picture of it) to discuss interesting problems. These conversations contributed to Saharon’s generalization of Arrow’s theorem and to his work with Micha Perles on “n-convexity.” Once, Saharon asked me to comment on an introduction for the general mathematical audience to his second book on classification theory. In 1994, Saharon and I shared the Pólya Prize in Combinatorics. My daughter was a classmate of Saharon’s son, so we also met occasionally at school events.\n\nMy friendship with Yuri began at Microsoft in the late 1990s. As a complete layman, I was fascinated by his approach to software engineering, which had a major impact on Microsoft. Yuri, in turn, was interested in my views on quantum computing—well before he became an active researcher in the field in 2013—and we discussed the topic frequently over the years. We also shared an interest in detecting deception using mathematical tools (see this post by Omer Reingold on his approach).\n\nHeartfelt congratulations to Saharon and Yuri!\n\nRonald de Wolf’s lecture on quantum proofs to classical theorems.\n\nAt YuriFest, Ronald de Wolf gave a great lecture on quantum proofs for classical theorems (the audio is a bit weak—turn the volume to 100%). One of his examples is discussed in this post. Yuri himself gave a wonderful talk titled The nature of nondeterministic probabilistic, quantum, etc. algorithms.\n\nReminder: Joram’s seminar on hypercontractivity and groups, Wednesday and Thursday, July 9 and 10, 2025.\n\nBy Gil Kalai\n\nRead original post\n"

In particular, over the Boolean cube ($S = {0,1}\n\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}$), the lemma asserts non-zero polynomials are non-zero\nwith probability at least $2^{-d}$. In this work we extend the ODLSZ lemma\noptimally (up to lower-order terms) to “Boolean slices” i.e., points of Hamming\nweight exactly $k$. We show that non-zero polynomials on the slice are non-zero\nwith probability $(t/n)^{d}(1 - o_{n}(1))$ where $t = \\min{k,n-k}$ for every\n$d\\leq k\\leq (n-d)$. As with the ODLSZ lemma, our results extend to polynomials\nover Abelian groups. This bound is tight (upto the error term) as evidenced by\ndegree d multilinear monomials. A particularly interesting case is the\n“balanced slice” ($k=n/2$) where our lemma asserts that non-zero polynomials\nare non-zero with roughly the same probability on the slice as on the whole\ncube.\nThe behaviour of low-degree polynomials over Boolean slices has received much\nattention in recent years. However, the problem of proving a tight version of\nthe ODLSZ lemma does not seem to have been considered before, except for a\nrecent work of Amireddy, Behera, Paraashar, Srinivasan and Sudan (SODA 2025)\nwho established a sub-optimal bound of approximately $((k/n)\\cdot(1-(k/n)))^d$\nusing a proof similar to that of the standard ODLSZ lemma.\nWhile the statement of our result mimics that of the ODLSZ lemma, our proof\nis significantly more intricate and involves spectral reasoning which is\nemployed to show that a natural way of embedding a copy of the Boolean cube\ninside a balanced Boolean slice is a good sampler.\n\nRead original post\n"

That is obviously interesting. What is less obvious (and  some of my co-bloggers disagree) the pursuit of actual values of BB is interesting. For an excellent overview of the BB numbers, written in 2020 (that is relevant) by Scott Aaronson, see here. (Computable and Aaronson are flagged by my spell check but I think they are spelled correctly.)\n\nWhen Scott’s article appeared, BB(5) was not known. In June 2024 the value of BB(5) was discovered.  See Scott’s blog on this, here. The value of BB(5) isn’t even that big- its just 47,176,870. That’s one of those numbers that is SMALL now but would have been LARGE in (say) 1964 (see my blog about a different number of that type here).\n\nWhat about BB(6)?\n\nNo, I am not going to announce that Scott announced it is now known.\n\nI am going to announced that Scott announced better lower bounds for BB(6) are now known.\n\nI won’t restate the lower bounds since (a) Scott already has, and (b) typesetting the bounds is hard (for me).\n\nSO, what to make of all this?\n\n1) At the time of Scott’s article it looked like BB(6) was large.

However, the ones mentioned in the context of BB(5) and BB(6) were verified in Coq.  I doubt other parts of math could take this approach;  however, it is interesting that results can be verified via computer in this field. Indeed- I doubt  referee could verify the results without a computer aid.\n\n4) Why the interest in BB? Some speculation\n\na) Computing power is such that one can actually get out some results (read Scott’s blog on BB(5) for more on that).\n\nb) The internet: there are not that many people working on BB but those that are can easily communicate with each other.\n\nc) Scott’s article and his blog posts on it helped generate interest.

Since queries are costly, the objective is to\nminimize the number of queries.\nIn the offline variant of this problem, we assume knowledge of the precise\nprofits and the task is to compute a query set of minimum cardinality that a\nthird party without access to the profits could use to identify an optimal (or\napproximate) knapsack solution.

      "content": "\n\nScrolling through discourse about the evil vector, I stumbled across a group of people dismayed that the papers they were reviewing for NeurIPS didn’t include proper error bars. In fact, I learned that there’s a checklist that authors must fill out and attach to every NeurIPS submission. You can still learn things on social media.\n\nThe NeurIPS program chairs introduced the checklist in 2021. They argued that the community wanted “both more guidance around how to perform machine learning research responsibly and more flexibility in how they discuss this in their papers.” They came to this conclusion after listening at the “NeurIPS 2020 broader impacts workshop,” a fully remote workshop held during the cold, dark winter of the second wave of the covid pandemic. They argued that they would experiment with a checklist as a way to facilitate more responsible machine learning.\n\nThey called the checklist “experimental,” though there is no control group.1 They hoped that “future Program Chairs will continue to improve and evolve the checklist in subsequent years.” You don’t have to be a bureaucracy scholar to know that checklists “improve and evolve” by metastasizing in length and complexity. And that’s precisely what we’ve seen.\n\nThe NeurIPS paper checklist is now 3800 words long. This is twice as long as the original checklist, and has 3 times as many items to check off. It’s a lot of ridiculous infantilizing boilerplate. Item 1: “Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?” Come on, folks. You are required to check that you have read the code of ethics (another 2000 words here). You are asked to check whether you obtained the appropriate IRB approvals. Of course, this only applies if you are at a university. There’s a call out to the AI Safety dorks: “Do you have safeguards in place for responsible release of models with a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models)?” Come on, folks!\n\nBut I’m particularly fascinated by the weird obsession with statistics. I imagine Leo Breiman is chuckling up in heaven that one of the two cultures is trying to strangle the more successful one.2 In 2021, there was a single line about statistics:\n\n\n  2021: Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?\n\n\nHonestly, not the worst question in the world. So much of machine learning and AI is based on randomized algorithms, and it’s good to check whether you have a stable result (i.e., training a neural net for classification) or a wildly variable result (i.e., using reinforcement learning to game a robotics simulator). But someone on the steering committee decided we needed a longer rule set and more statistics. The statistics creep began in 2023:\n\n\n  2023: If you ran experiments, did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times), or other information about the statistical significance of your experiments?\n\n\nAnd eventually, due to some unknown person’s lobbying, these were expanded further in 2024:\n\n\n  2024: “The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.). The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, the authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.”\n\n\nWhat does this have to do with anything? If I run my code ten times, why should you care if I properly account for normal approximations? Who does this help?\n\nAnyway, I love that NeurIPS is proving my central thesis about statistics: Statistics is a bunch of arbitrary rules we use for approval. These arbitrary rules have now found their way into the machine learning publication machine. Whereas I understand why we require statistical tests when approving pharmaceuticals, no one has provided an explanation for why (or if) these statistical guidelines improve the quality of the thirty thousand NeurIPS submissions.\n\nIndeed, I can’t figure out why people have become so obsessed with error bars in machine learning. I have been told that it’s because data sets are “small” now. For example, some of the “can LLM solve human tests” data sets have a few dozen questions. The AIME benchmark has 15. But what do frequentist error bars buy you here? This isn’t like Fisher’s friend who tastes tea. If a machine can solve a single one of these problems, it’s interesting! LLM answers are variable by design. Trying to gauge this variability with “Gaussian approximations to the standard errors of the mean” misses the forest for the trees. Indeed, if you only have 15 questions in a dataset, you don’t need statistics. Just look at the answers! We’re not grading the LLM on a curve here.\n\nThe obsession with statistics is particularly ironic because the advances in machine learning from the past 15 years have been entirely based on optimaxxing vibes. While program committees and responsible ethics boards fixate on procedure, the big ideas have come from “this feels right,” whether they be bigger convnets, ADAM optimizers, attention mechanisms, or anything in RL. Do you think recent trends in transformer architectures like using RMSNorm instead of Layernorm or SwiGLU instead of ReLU are undergirded by deep statistical grounding?3\n\nWhat gives away the whole checklist charade here is bullet 4. The rules say that you must disclose the normal approximations in your error bars, but you don’t have to release code.\n\n\n  “While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, we do require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.“\n\n\nWhy no code? It’s because a substantial fraction of NeurIPS papers come from private companies. The biggest models come from private companies. The conference exists to enrich Sam Altman. There’s no recruiting fair, no late-night parties, no signing bonuses based on Google Scholar profiles without the corporate commitment. So we can pat ourselves on the back and tell ourselves we’re being responsible researchers as we fill out our checklists and format our error bars. But let’s not kid ourselves about what we’re participating in.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nI couldn’t find the preregistration plan.\n\n2\n\nThere is still no statistically significant evidence to support the existence of heaven.\n\n3\n\nLike you, I don’t know what any of these things are.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum\ncryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer,\nprovide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies\n$PP\\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the\nanalogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \\neq NP$-has long\nbeen studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning\nin various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to\n$P \\neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for\nOWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of\nOWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution\nlearning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper\nquantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that\nfollows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution\nlearning can be derived from $PP \\neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to\naverage-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from\n$PP \\neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if\nworst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \\neq\nSampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite\nthat, we show that $PP \\neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of\nhardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \\neq BQP$ if and only if\nagnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard.\nAs a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning\nwith respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\\Sigma_3^P}$ learners\nimplies $SampBQP \\neq SampBPP$.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Susanna Caroppo, Giordano Da Lozzo, Giuseppe Di Battista, Michael T. Goodrich, Martin Nöllenburg\n\nWe introduce a quantum dynamic programming framework that allows us to\ndirectly extend to the quantum realm a large body of classical dynamic\nprogramming algorithms. The corresponding quantum dynamic programming\nalgorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart,\nwhile achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or\noptimization) problem $\\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\\mathcal P$, such a\nspeedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\\delta$ of the\ndependency digraph $G_{\\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive\nformulation of $\\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of\n$\\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to\nthose on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to\nsolve the considered problems in $\\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\\mathcal{P}}(I))|\n\\sqrt{\\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the\nBellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex\nto all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that\nruns in $\\tilde{O}(n\\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical\nupper bound when $m \\in \\Omega(n^{1.4})$.\n\nRead original post\n"

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nnon-constant inapproximability result known for this problem. We also\nstrengthen the known \\np-hardness of the problem on $2$-apex graphs by showing\nthat the same result holds for $1$-apex graphs. This leaves open the problem of\ndetermining whether the problem remains \\np-hard on planar (i.e., $0$-apex)\ngraphs.\nOn the positive side, we design an algorithm that computes good approximate\nsolutions for hereditary graph classes that admit efficiently computable\nbalanced separators of truly sublinear size. This immediately results in\npolynomial-time approximation algorithms achieving an approximation ratio of\n$O(n^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\sqrt{\\log n})$ on planar graphs, graphs with bounded genus,\nand $k$-apex graphs with $k=O(n^{\\frac{1}{4}})$. On graphs with bounded\ntreewidth, we obtain an approximation ratio of $O(\\log^{3/2} n)$ for any\nconstant $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$. This compares favorably with the best-known\napproximation algorithm for general graphs, which achieves an approximation\nratio of $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ via a simple reduction to the \\textsc{Set Cover}\nproblem.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Kanazawa was this year’s host of Computational Geometry Week and the Symposium on Computational Geometry, and a great place to visit for lots of reasons. One of the lesser reasons is that it also hosts an interesting collection of geometric street art, some of which I photographed on my recent visit.\n\nThe first thing you see as you enter the city by the main entrance of its train station is Tsuzumimon, a massive ornamental wooden gate. The two pillars of the gate are made from wood beams in two layers that twist around each pillar in opposite directions. The lintel connecting the two pillars is a lattice of more wood, in a rounded form rather than the more traditional straight beam. The gate supports one end of an airy steel and glass space-frame dome, sheltering the plaza in front of the station from the frequent rain.\n\n\n\nTsuzumi are a certain type of Japanese hand drum, so Tsuzumimon means drum gate, because of the resemblance of the pillars to these drums. But instead, what it most reminds me of is a partition of space into skew lines that I ray-traced in 2010 and use as the header for my Mastodon account page.\n\n\n\nA short way along the road to the fish market (worth multiple visits), one encounters this piece, “Corpus Minor #1” by Janne Kristian Virkkunen. Another conference participant told me he thought it resembled a shipping mine, but what it brings to mind to me is either an atomic nucleus or a morula (the complex of cells of a multi-cell organism at the stage of reproduction before they differentiate).\n\n\n\nHere’s a more abstracted close-up look.\n\n\n\nI’m pretty sure its underlying geometric structure comes from a tetrakis hexahedron, whose edges form the prominent ribs of the sculpture. This would allow it to be constructed by bolting together 24 identical triangular pieces, each containing smoothed-together patches from three of the 14 spherical bulges of the sculpture.\n\n\n\nThe part of Kanazawa between the station and the fish market is dominated by major boulevards filled with cars, and long waits for crosswalks. To make it somewhat less unfriendly to pedestrian traffic, the city has installed underpasses at several of the major crossings. It’s easy to miss the next piece, at the central hub of the underpass connecting to the fish market itself.\n\n\n\nAlso seen but not photographed: another large ornamental gate near the back entrance of the station, made of slanted concrete pillars and resembling a support structure for an elevated highway; a black stone monkey saddle in the basement level of the station, near a scale model of Tsuzumimon; a tangled tree of shiny stainless steel tubes across the street from my hotel (a block south of the station); a stylized sundial between the station and the fish market (not very effective in the rain); and many public fountains.\n\n(Discuss on Mastodon)\n\nBy David Eppstein\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "\n\nToday marks the 2nd anniversary of this substack, and my elaborate blogging rule book compels me to write an annual reflection post. Whereas the first year was experimental and finding my footing, the second year has been decidedly more routine. That’s not a bad thing, as I love rituals. Wake up, brush my teeth, make two pour-over coffees, be harassed by the cat, blog.1 There’s a reassurance in these daily rituals themselves, where the process can be as rewarding as the product.\n\nI’m only half joking about having a blogging rule book. I’ve never written it down, but some of the rules are\n\n\n  Spend the first hour of each working day blogging.\n  Aim for 1000 words. If I hit that number, publish.\n  If I don’t hit 1000 words today, try to finish the piece tomorrow.\n  Make equations with LaTeXit, 14 pt font.\n  Every equation halves your readership (This is a Stephen Hawking rule.)\n  Don’t overthink the titles.\n  A banner by Isaac Sparks goes at the top of each post, subscribe button at the bottom.\n  14:00 GMT is international posting time. (This is a Brian Whitman rule.)\n  Aim for two posts a week. Don’t post more than four.\n\n\nI have a different set of rules for class liveblogging. I invented my own set of rules for working through Meehl’s course. Maybe I should spend more time writing these rules down. I’m sure there are many more I haven’t even articulated to myself.\n\nWhatever the case, I’ve got a process now and I’m sticking to it. The rules are oddly freeing. Rules give you a “freedom from choice,” paring down the degrees of freedom to one where you are able to create but are not overwhelmed by options. They are “constraints that deconstrain,” facilitating improvisation within the narrow boundaries of the ruleset.\n\nPart of my obsession with bureaucracy is that I love rules, and yet bureaucratic rules so frequently lack the deconstraining property that lets people flourish. Making matters worse, bureaucratic processes stifle course correction because by their nature. They are necessarily ossified and onerous to change. That’s a topic for a longer conversation in another post.\n\nIn any event, while I don’t have a clear idea of the topics I’ll be covering in year three of the argmin substack, I do know the starting rule book I’ll be using. And I’m trying to think a bit about rule changes for the upcoming season.2\n\nPart of these rule changes will be adapting to new goals for this season. One thing I haven’t been able to do is use my blogging time as “real writing” time. I’ve taken some mornings and tried to work on other writing projects during my allotted blogging time, and it hasn’t been helpful. That’s interesting in itself. This blog post writing is fundamentally different from the more archival writing, and the latter needs its own set of rules.\n\nI should figure those rules out because I am in a stage where I should write a few more papers. You know, blog posts with DOIs. I don’t want to write too many papers, but some folks have suggested that it would be helpful to collect and collate some of the meandering thoughts here into tighter arguments. My blog posts are first drafts of thoughts, not finished ones. I don’t consider any of the arguments here to be definitive. I love that you all think out loud with me. Nonetheless, some of them are worth preserving in academic amber, and I need to do my scholarly duties of mailing pdfs to my friends. I’ve written two blog posts with DOIs this year (this one, that one), and I have three or four more I should try to finish. I also have a few more books in me that I want to write. I will have more news on that front coming very soon. Finding the right way to balance writing time is going to be an important part of argmin year three.\n\nAnother goal is finding the best balance for the multiple audiences who read this. Some posts get very technical, but there is a slice of the readership that enjoys those. I have tried to maintain a balance that doesn’t alienate those who don’t want the math, while also engaging with those who do. I could split this blog into multiple newsletters, but that seems like a lot of unnecessary work, and I know everyone must have incredible substack subscription fatigue at this point. I could perhaps signal at the top of each post whether I’m going to get into the weeds. If you have any ideas on how to strike the right balance and send the right signals, please send me an email or leave a comment. Hopefully, you folks who agree to be spammed by me are fine with closing the posts that are too hypertechnical and selectively reading the ones that hook you.\n\nRegardless, I love the feedback you send me, and I apologize if I miss any or don’t reply. I read them all and value them all. I look forward to more of them in year three.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nThe cat apparently also loves rituals.\n\n2\n\nArgmin blog will not be banning the tush push.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

In particular, PTOPP\nis utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its\nentire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As\npassages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core\nidea is to leverage the path’s passage traversal status to characterize its\naccessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection\nand free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,\nenabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment\ndecompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with\naccessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems\ncompatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based\nalgorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are\ndeveloped leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.\nAll these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and\nefficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based\nmethods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution\noptimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It\nis believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free\nspace optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad\nclass of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.\n\nRead original post\n"

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various\nexamples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in\napplications such as fabrication and animation.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Zach Hunter, Aleksa Milojević, Istvan Tomon, Benny Sudakov\n\nThe Zarankiewicz problem, a cornerstone problem in extremal graph theory,\nasks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that does not\ncontain the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,s}$. While the problem remains\nwidely open in the case of general graphs, the past two decades have seen\nsignificant progress on this problem for various restricted graph classes –\nparticularly those arising from geometric settings – leading to a deeper\nunderstanding of their structure.\nIn this paper, we develop a new structural tool for addressing\nZarankiewicz-type problems. More specifically, we show that for any positive\ninteger $k$, every graph with average degree $d$ either contains an induced\n$C_4$-free subgraph with average degree at least $k$, or it contains a\n$d$-vertex subgraph with $\\Omega_k(d^2)$ edges. As an application of this\ndichotomy, we propose a unified approach to a large number of Zarankiewicz-type\nproblems in geometry, obtaining optimal bounds in each case.\n\nRead original post\n"

We also\npresent further structural results about Boolean matrices of bounded\n$\\gamma_2$-norm and discuss applications in communication complexity, operator\ntheory, spectral graph theory, and extremal combinatorics.\nAs a key application, we establish an inverse theorem for MaxCut. A\ncelebrated result of Edwards states that every graph $G$ with $m$ edges has a\ncut of size at least $\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{8m+1}-1}{8}$, with equality\nachieved by complete graphs with an odd number of vertices. To contrast this,\nwe prove that if the MaxCut of $G$ is at most $\\frac{m}{2}+O(\\sqrt{m})$, then\n$G$ must contain a clique of size $\\Omega(\\sqrt{m})$.\n\nRead original post\n"

This extends a\nrecent result of Andrews &amp; Wigderson who showed such an upper bound over fields\nof zero or large characteristic.\nOur proofs are based on a recent work of Bhattacharjee, Kumar, Rai,\nRamanathan, Saptharishi \\&amp; Saraf that shows closure of constant depth algebraic\ncircuits under factorization. On our way to the proof, we show that any\n$n$-variate symmetric polynomial $P$ that has a small constant depth algebraic\ncircuit can be written as the composition of a small constant depth algebraic\ncircuit with elementary symmetric polynomials. This statement is a constant\ndepth version of a result of Bl\"{a}ser &amp; Jindal, who showed this for algebraic\ncircuits of unbounded depth.

In other words, we show that if a multivariate polynomial over\na field of characteristic zero has a small constant-depth circuit or formula,\nthen all its factors can be computed by small constant-depth circuits or\nformulas respectively.\nOur result turns out to be an elementary consequence of a fundamental and\nsurprising result of Furstenberg from the 1960s, which gives a non-iterative\ndescription of the power series roots of a bivariate polynomial. Combined with\nstandard structural ideas in algebraic complexity, we observe that this theorem\nyields the desired closure results.\nAs applications, we get alternative (and perhaps simpler) proofs of various\nknown results and strengthen the quantitative bounds in some of them.

In\nparticular, we show that natural restrictions on linearity and derivation along\nfunctions with specific growth rate correspond to kinds of functions that can\nbe proved to be in various classes, ranging from FAC^0 to FAC^1. This reveals\nan intriguing link between constraints over linear-length ODEs and circuit\ncomputation, providing new tools to tackle the complex challenge of\nestablishing bounds for classes in the circuit hierarchies and possibly\nenhancing our understanding of the role of counters in this setting.\nAdditionally, we establish several completeness results, in particular\nobtaining the first ODE-based characterizations for the classes of functions\ncomputable in constant depth with unbounded fan-in and Mod 2 gates (FACC[2])\nand in logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in Boolean gates (FNC1).\n\nRead original post\n"
