      "content": "Authors: Vaidehi Srinivas\n\nWe study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that\ndirectly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target\nmiscoverage rate $\\alpha &gt; 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \\le T$ an\nalgorithm must output an interval $I_t \\subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \\in\n[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,\n$y_t \\in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \\alpha)$-fraction of days, while\nmaintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the\nintervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of\nconstructing efficient confidence intervals.\nWe study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input\nsequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct\nintervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \\alpha) - o(1)$, while having length\nupper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.\nFor arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a\n$\\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval\nachieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more\nmistakes than $\\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\\mu$ and\nthe aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching\nalgorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\\mu$ and number of\nmistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to\nan adaptive adversary.\nThis gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to\nthe classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single\nalgorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and\noptimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an\nalgorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Anders Aamand, Maryam Aliakbarpour, Justin Y. Chen, Shyam Narayanan, Sandeep Silwal\n\nA hypothesis testing algorithm is replicable if, when run on two different\nsamples from the same distribution, it produces the same output with high\nprobability. This notion, defined by by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorell\n[STOCâ22], can increase trust in testing procedures and is deeply related to\nalgorithmic stability, generalization, and privacy. We build general tools to\nprove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers,\nunifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.\nWe identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable\ntesting algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening\naccuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a\ndeterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds\nagainst a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in\nwhich the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,ââ\nthen the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,\nresolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPSâ24]. We prove new lower\nbounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case\nwhere the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.\nWe systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm\ndesign based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.\nOur framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the\nnon-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead. As direct\napplications of our framework, we obtain constant-factor optimal bounds for\ncoin testing and closeness testing and get replicability for free in a large\nparameter regime for uniformity testing.\nWe also give state-of-the-art bounds for replicable Gaussian mean testing,\nand, unlike prior work, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Jens SchlÃ¶ter\n\nIn the knapsack problem under explorable uncertainty, we are given a knapsack\ninstance with uncertain item profits. Instead of having access to the precise\nprofits, we are only given uncertainty intervals that are guaranteed to contain\nthe corresponding profits. The actual item profit can be obtained via a query.\nThe goal of the problem is to adaptively query item profits until the revealed\ninformation suffices to compute an optimal (or approximate) solution to the\nunderlying knapsack instance. Since queries are costly, the objective is to\nminimize the number of queries.\nIn the offline variant of this problem, we assume knowledge of the precise\nprofits and the task is to compute a query set of minimum cardinality that a\nthird party without access to the profits could use to identify an optimal (or\napproximate) knapsack solution. We show that this offline variant is complete\nfor the second-level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\\Sigma_2^p$-complete,\nand cannot be approximated within a non-trivial factor unless $\\Sigma_2^p =\n\\Delta_2^p$. Motivated by these strong hardness results, we consider a\nresource-augmented variant of the problem where the requirements on the query\nset computed by an algorithm are less strict than the requirements on the\noptimal solution we compare against. More precisely, a query set computed by\nthe algorithm must reveal sufficient information to identify an approximate\nknapsack solution, while the optimal query set we compare against has to reveal\nsufficient information to identify an optimal solution. We show that this\nresource-augmented setting allows interesting non-trivial algorithmic results.\n\nRead original post\n"

A\nstreaming or online algorithm is called adversarially-robust if it succeeds\nwith high probability on input streams that may change adaptively depending on\nprevious algorithm outputs. Unfortunately, the dependence between stream\nelements breaks the analysis of most randomized algorithms, and in particular\nthat of importance-sampling algorithms. Previously, Braverman et al.

In\nparticular, we show that the relationships between these two entropy measures\nare similar to those between the corresponding well-known measures for strings.\nWe use these measures to prove that the XBWT of a trie can be encoded within a\nspace bounded by our k-th order empirical entropy plus a o(n) term, with n\nbeing the number of nodes in the trie. Notably, as happens for strings, this\nspace bound can be reached for every sufficiently small k simultaneously.\nFinally, we compare the space complexity of the above index with that of the\nr-index for tries proposed by Prezza [SODA â21] and we prove that in some cases\nthe FM-index for tries is asymptotically smaller.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Tomasz Kociumaka, Ali Shahali\n\nThe tree edit distance is a natural dissimilarity measure between rooted\nordered trees whose nodes are labeled over an alphabet $\\Sigma$.

In the weighted variant, the\nedits have associated costs (depending on the involved node labels) normalized\nso that each cost is at least one, and the goal is to minimize the total cost\nof edits.\nThe unweighted tree edit distance between two trees of total size $n$ can be\ncomputed in $O(n^{2.6857})$ time; in contrast, determining the weighted tree\nedit distance is fine-grained equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Paths\nproblem and requires $n^3/2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ time [Nogler et al.;\nSTOCâ25]. These super-quadratic running times are unattractive for large but\nvery similar trees, which motivates the bounded version of the problem, where\nthe runtime is parameterized by the computed distance $k$, potentially yielding\nfaster algorithms for $k\\ll n$.\nPrevious best algorithms for the bounded unweighted setting run in\n$O(nk^2\\log n)$ time [Akmal &amp; Jin; ICALPâ21] and $O(n + k^7\\log k)$ time [Das\net al.; STOCâ23].

In fact, I learned that thereâs a checklist that authors must fill out and attach to every NeurIPS submission. You can still learn things on social media.\n\nThe NeurIPS program chairs introduced the checklist in 2021. They argued that the community wanted âboth more guidance around how to perform machine learning research responsibly and more flexibility in how they discuss this in their papers.â They came to this conclusion after listening at the âNeurIPS 2020 broader impacts workshop,â a fully remote workshop held during the cold, dark winter of the second wave of the covid pandemic. They argued that they would experiment with a checklist as a way to facilitate more responsible machine learning.\n\nThey called the checklist âexperimental,â though there is no control group.1 They hoped that âfuture Program Chairs will continue to improve and evolve the checklist in subsequent years.â You donât have to be a bureaucracy scholar to know that checklists âimprove and evolveâ by metastasizing in length and complexity. And thatâs precisely what weâve seen.\n\nThe NeurIPS paper checklist is now 3800 words long. This is twice as long as the original checklist, and has 3 times as many items to check off.

You are required to check that you have read the code of ethics (another 2000 words here). You are asked to check whether you obtained the appropriate IRB approvals. Of course, this only applies if you are at a university. Thereâs a call out to the AI Safety dorks: âDo you have safeguards in place for responsible release of models with a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models)?â Come on, folks!\n\nBut Iâm particularly fascinated by the weird obsession with statistics. I imagine Leo Breiman is chuckling up in heaven that one of the two cultures is trying to strangle the more successful one.2 In 2021, there was a single line about statistics:\n\n\n  2021: Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?\n\n\nHonestly, not the worst question in the world. So much of machine learning and AI is based on randomized algorithms, and itâs good to check whether you have a stable result (i.e., training a neural net for classification) or a wildly variable result (i.e., using reinforcement learning to game a robotics simulator). But someone on the steering committee decided we needed a longer rule set and more statistics. The statistics creep began in 2023:\n\n\n  2023: If you ran experiments, did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times), or other information about the statistical significance of your experiments?\n\n\nAnd eventually, due to some unknown personâs lobbying, these were expanded further in 2024:\n\n\n  2024: âThe factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.). The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, the authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.â\n\n\nWhat does this have to do with anything? If I run my code ten times, why should you care if I properly account for normal approximations? Who does this help?\n\nAnyway, I love that NeurIPS is proving my central thesis about statistics: Statistics is a bunch of arbitrary rules we use for approval. These arbitrary rules have now found their way into the machine learning publication machine. Whereas I understand why we require statistical tests when approving pharmaceuticals, no one has provided an explanation for why (or if) these statistical guidelines improve the quality of the thirty thousand NeurIPS submissions.\n\nIndeed, I canât figure out why people have become so obsessed with error bars in machine learning. I have been told that itâs because data sets are âsmallâ now. For example, some of the âcan LLM solve human testsâ data sets have a few dozen questions. The AIME benchmark has 15. But what do frequentist error bars buy you here? This isnât like Fisherâs friend who tastes tea. If a machine can solve a single one of these problems, itâs interesting! LLM answers are variable by design. Trying to gauge this variability with âGaussian approximations to the standard errors of the meanâ misses the forest for the trees. Indeed, if you only have 15 questions in a dataset, you donât need statistics. Just look at the answers! Weâre not grading the LLM on a curve here.\n\nThe obsession with statistics is particularly ironic because the advances in machine learning from the past 15 years have been entirely based on optimaxxing vibes. While program committees and responsible ethics boards fixate on procedure, the big ideas have come from âthis feels right,â whether they be bigger convnets, ADAM optimizers, attention mechanisms, or anything in RL. Do you think recent trends in transformer architectures like using RMSNorm instead of Layernorm or SwiGLU instead of ReLU are undergirded by deep statistical grounding?3\n\nWhat gives away the whole checklist charade here is bullet 4. The rules say that you must disclose the normal approximations in your error bars, but you donât have to release code.\n\n\n  âWhile NeurIPS does not require releasing code, we do require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.â\n\n\nWhy no code? Itâs because a substantial fraction of NeurIPS papers come from private companies. The biggest models come from private companies. The conference exists to enrich Sam Altman. Thereâs no recruiting fair, no late-night parties, no signing bonuses based on Google Scholar profiles without the corporate commitment. So we can pat ourselves on the back and tell ourselves weâre being responsible researchers as we fill out our checklists and format our error bars. But letâs not kid ourselves about what weâre participating in.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nI couldnât find the preregistration plan.\n\n2\n\nThere is still no statistically significant evidence to support the existence of heaven.\n\n3\n\nLike you, I donât know what any of these things are.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

The existence of OWPuzzs implies\n$PP\\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the\nanalogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \\neq NP$-has long\nbeen studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning\nin various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to\n$P \\neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for\nOWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of\nOWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution\nlearning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper\nquantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that\nfollows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution\nlearning can be derived from $PP \\neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to\naverage-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from\n$PP \\neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if\nworst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \\neq\nSampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite\nthat, we show that $PP \\neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of\nhardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \\neq BQP$ if and only if\nagnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard.\nAs a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning\nwith respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\\Sigma_3^P}$ learners\nimplies $SampBQP \\neq SampBPP$.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Casper Moldrup Rysgaard, Sebastian Wild\n\nLazy search trees (Sandlund &amp; Wild FOCS 2020, Sandlund &amp; Zhang SODA 2022) are\nsorted dictionaries whose update and query performance smoothly interpolates\nbetween that of efficient priority queues and binary search trees -\nautomatically, depending on actual use; no adjustments are necessary to the\ndata structure to realize the cost savings. In this paper, we design lazy\nB-trees, a variant of lazy search trees suitable for external memory that\ngeneralizes the speedup of B-trees over binary search trees wrt. input/output\noperations to the same smooth interpolation regime.\nA key technical difficulty to overcome is the lack of a (fully satisfactory)\nexternal variant of biased search trees, on which lazy search trees crucially\nrely. We give a construction for a subset of performance guarantees sufficient\nto realize external-memory lazy search trees, which we deem of independent\ninterest.\nAs one special case, lazy B-trees can be used as an external-memory priority\nqueue, in which case they are competitive with some tailor-made heaps; indeed,\nthey offer faster decrease-key and insert operations than known data\nstructures.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Kanazawa was this yearâs host of Computational Geometry Week and the Symposium on Computational Geometry, and a great place to visit for lots of reasons. One of the lesser reasons is that it also hosts an interesting collection of geometric street art, some of which I photographed on my recent visit.\n\nThe first thing you see as you enter the city by the main entrance of its train station is Tsuzumimon, a massive ornamental wooden gate. The two pillars of the gate are made from wood beams in two layers that twist around each pillar in opposite directions. The lintel connecting the two pillars is a lattice of more wood, in a rounded form rather than the more traditional straight beam. The gate supports one end of an airy steel and glass space-frame dome, sheltering the plaza in front of the station from the frequent rain.\n\n\n\nTsuzumi are a certain type of Japanese hand drum, so Tsuzumimon means drum gate, because of the resemblance of the pillars to these drums. But instead, what it most reminds me of is a partition of space into skew lines that I ray-traced in 2010 and use as the header for my Mastodon account page.\n\n\n\nA short way along the road to the fish market (worth multiple visits), one encounters this piece, âCorpus Minor #1â by Janne Kristian Virkkunen. Another conference participant told me he thought it resembled a shipping mine, but what it brings to mind to me is either an atomic nucleus or a morula (the complex of cells of a multi-cell organism at the stage of reproduction before they differentiate).\n\n\n\nHereâs a more abstracted close-up look.\n\n\n\nIâm pretty sure its underlying geometric structure comes from a tetrakis hexahedron, whose edges form the prominent ribs of the sculpture. This would allow it to be constructed by bolting together 24 identical triangular pieces, each containing smoothed-together patches from three of the 14 spherical bulges of the sculpture.\n\n\n\nThe part of Kanazawa between the station and the fish market is dominated by major boulevards filled with cars, and long waits for crosswalks. To make it somewhat less unfriendly to pedestrian traffic, the city has installed underpasses at several of the major crossings. Itâs easy to miss the next piece, at the central hub of the underpass connecting to the fish market itself.\n\n\n\nAlso seen but not photographed: another large ornamental gate near the back entrance of the station, made of slanted concrete pillars and resembling a support structure for an elevated highway; a black stone monkey saddle in the basement level of the station, near a scale model of Tsuzumimon; a tangled tree of shiny stainless steel tubes across the street from my hotel (a block south of the station); a stylized sundial between the station and the fish market (not very effective in the rain); and many public fountains.\n\n(Discuss on Mastodon)\n\nBy David Eppstein\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "\n\nToday marks the 2nd anniversary of this substack, and my elaborate blogging rule book compels me to write an annual reflection post. Whereas the first year was experimental and finding my footing, the second year has been decidedly more routine. Thatâs not a bad thing, as I love rituals. Wake up, brush my teeth, make two pour-over coffees, be harassed by the cat, blog.1 Thereâs a reassurance in these daily rituals themselves, where the process can be as rewarding as the product.\n\nIâm only half joking about having a blogging rule book. Iâve never written it down, but some of the rules are\n\n\n  Spend the first hour of each working day blogging.\n  Aim for 1000 words. If I hit that number, publish.\n  If I donât hit 1000 words today, try to finish the piece tomorrow.\n  Make equations with LaTeXit, 14 pt font.\n  Every equation halves your readership (This is a Stephen Hawking rule.)\n  Donât overthink the titles.\n  A banner by Isaac Sparks goes at the top of each post, subscribe button at the bottom.\n  14:00 GMT is international posting time. (This is a Brian Whitman rule.)\n  Aim for two posts a week. Donât post more than four.\n\n\nI have a different set of rules for class liveblogging. I invented my own set of rules for working through Meehlâs course. Maybe I should spend more time writing these rules down. Iâm sure there are many more I havenât even articulated to myself.\n\nWhatever the case, Iâve got a process now and Iâm sticking to it. The rules are oddly freeing. Rules give you a âfreedom from choice,â paring down the degrees of freedom to one where you are able to create but are not overwhelmed by options. They are âconstraints that deconstrain,â facilitating improvisation within the narrow boundaries of the ruleset.\n\nPart of my obsession with bureaucracy is that I love rules, and yet bureaucratic rules so frequently lack the deconstraining property that lets people flourish. Making matters worse, bureaucratic processes stifle course correction because by their nature. They are necessarily ossified and onerous to change. Thatâs a topic for a longer conversation in another post.\n\nIn any event, while I donât have a clear idea of the topics Iâll be covering in year three of the argmin substack, I do know the starting rule book Iâll be using. And Iâm trying to think a bit about rule changes for the upcoming season.2\n\nPart of these rule changes will be adapting to new goals for this season. One thing I havenât been able to do is use my blogging time as âreal writingâ time. Iâve taken some mornings and tried to work on other writing projects during my allotted blogging time, and it hasnât been helpful. Thatâs interesting in itself. This blog post writing is fundamentally different from the more archival writing, and the latter needs its own set of rules.\n\nI should figure those rules out because I am in a stage where I should write a few more papers. You know, blog posts with DOIs. I donât want to write too many papers, but some folks have suggested that it would be helpful to collect and collate some of the meandering thoughts here into tighter arguments. My blog posts are first drafts of thoughts, not finished ones. I donât consider any of the arguments here to be definitive. I love that you all think out loud with me. Nonetheless, some of them are worth preserving in academic amber, and I need to do my scholarly duties of mailing pdfs to my friends. Iâve written two blog posts with DOIs this year (this one, that one), and I have three or four more I should try to finish. I also have a few more books in me that I want to write. I will have more news on that front coming very soon. Finding the right way to balance writing time is going to be an important part of argmin year three.\n\nAnother goal is finding the best balance for the multiple audiences who read this. Some posts get very technical, but there is a slice of the readership that enjoys those. I have tried to maintain a balance that doesnât alienate those who donât want the math, while also engaging with those who do. I could split this blog into multiple newsletters, but that seems like a lot of unnecessary work, and I know everyone must have incredible substack subscription fatigue at this point. I could perhaps signal at the top of each post whether Iâm going to get into the weeds. If you have any ideas on how to strike the right balance and send the right signals, please send me an email or leave a comment. Hopefully, you folks who agree to be spammed by me are fine with closing the posts that are too hypertechnical and selectively reading the ones that hook you.\n\nRegardless, I love the feedback you send me, and I apologize if I miss any or donât reply. I read them all and value them all. I look forward to more of them in year three.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nThe cat apparently also loves rituals.\n\n2\n\nArgmin blog will not be banning the tush push.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n\nRead original post\n"

While most local search algorithms aim\nto improve given solutions by performing one single operation on a given\nsolution, the parameterized approach aims to improve a solution by performing\n$k$ simultaneous operations. Herein, $k$ is a parameter called search radius\nfor which the value can be chosen by a user. One major goal in the field of\nparameterized local search is to outline the trade-off between the size of $k$\nand the running time of the local search step. In this work, we introduce an\nabstract framework that generalizes natural parameterized local search\napproaches for a large class of partitioning problems: Given $n$ items that are\npartitioned into $b$ bins and a target function that evaluates the quality of\nthe current partition, one asks whether it is possible to improve the solution\nby removing up to $k$ items from their current bins and reassigning them to\nother bins.

We also\npresent further structural results about Boolean matrices of bounded\n$\\gamma_2$-norm and discuss applications in communication complexity, operator\ntheory, spectral graph theory, and extremal combinatorics.\nAs a key application, we establish an inverse theorem for MaxCut. A\ncelebrated result of Edwards states that every graph $G$ with $m$ edges has a\ncut of size at least $\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{8m+1}-1}{8}$, with equality\nachieved by complete graphs with an odd number of vertices. To contrast this,\nwe prove that if the MaxCut of $G$ is at most $\\frac{m}{2}+O(\\sqrt{m})$, then\n$G$ must contain a clique of size $\\Omega(\\sqrt{m})$.\n\nRead original post\n"

      "content": "Authors: Sipra Singh\n\nIn a large-scale network, we want to choose some influential nodes to make a\nprofit by paying some cost within a limited budget so that we do not have to\nspend more budget on some nodes adjacent to the chosen nodes; our problem is\nthe graph-theoretic representation of it. We define our problem Dominating Set\nKnapsack by attaching Knapsack Problem with Dominating Set on graphs. Each\nvertex is associated with a cost factor and a profit amount. We aim to choose\nsome vertices within a fixed budget that gives maximum profit so that we do not\nneed to choose their 1-hop neighbors. We show that the Dominating Set Knapsack\nproblem is strongly NP-complete even when restricted to Bipartite graphs but\nweakly NP-complete for Star graphs. We present a pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm for Trees in time $O(n\\cdot min{s^2, (\\alpha(V))^2})$. We show that\nDominating Set Knapsack is very unlikely to be Fixed Parameter Tractable(FPT)\nby proving that it is in W[2]-hard parameterized by the solution size. We\ndeveloped FPT algorithms with running time $O(4^{tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)} \\cdot\nmin{s^2,{\\alpha(V)}^2})$ and $O(2^{vck-1}\\cdot n^{O(1)} \\cdot\nmin{s^2,{\\alpha(V)}^2})$, where $tw$ represents the treewidth of the given\ngraph, $vck$ is the solution size of the Vertex Cover Knapsack, $s$ is the size\nof the knapsack and $\\alpha(V)=\\sum_{v\\in V}\\alpha(v)$.\n\nRead original post\n"

This extends a\nrecent result of Andrews &amp; Wigderson who showed such an upper bound over fields\nof zero or large characteristic.\nOur proofs are based on a recent work of Bhattacharjee, Kumar, Rai,\nRamanathan, Saptharishi \\&amp; Saraf that shows closure of constant depth algebraic\ncircuits under factorization. On our way to the proof, we show that any\n$n$-variate symmetric polynomial $P$ that has a small constant depth algebraic\ncircuit can be written as the composition of a small constant depth algebraic\ncircuit with elementary symmetric polynomials. This statement is a constant\ndepth version of a result of Bl\"{a}ser &amp; Jindal, who showed this for algebraic\ncircuits of unbounded depth. As an application of our techniques, we also\nstrengthen the closure results for factors of constant-depth circuits in the\nwork of Bhattacharjee et al. over fields for small characteristic.\n\nRead original post\n"

In\nparticular, we show that natural restrictions on linearity and derivation along\nfunctions with specific growth rate correspond to kinds of functions that can\nbe proved to be in various classes, ranging from FAC^0 to FAC^1. This reveals\nan intriguing link between constraints over linear-length ODEs and circuit\ncomputation, providing new tools to tackle the complex challenge of\nestablishing bounds for classes in the circuit hierarchies and possibly\nenhancing our understanding of the role of counters in this setting.\nAdditionally, we establish several completeness results, in particular\nobtaining the first ODE-based characterizations for the classes of functions\ncomputable in constant depth with unbounded fan-in and Mod 2 gates (FACC[2])\nand in logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in Boolean gates (FNC1).\n\nRead original post\n"
