      "url": "/blog/2025/arxiv-computational-complexity-hardness-of-quantum-distribution-learning-and-quantum-cryptography/",
      "content": "Authors: Taiga Hiroka, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Tomoyuki Morimae\n\nThe existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in\nclassical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum\ncryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer,\nprovide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies\n$PP\\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the\nanalogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \\neq NP$-has long\nbeen studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning\nin various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to\n$P \\neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for\nOWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of\nOWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution\nlearning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper\nquantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that\nfollows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution\nlearning can be derived from $PP \\neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to\naverage-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from\n$PP \\neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if\nworst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \\neq\nSampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite\nthat, we show that $PP \\neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of\nhardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \\neq BQP$ if and only if\nagnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard.\nAs a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning\nwith respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\\Sigma_3^P}$ learners\nimplies $SampBQP \\neq SampBPP$.\n"

This research concentrates on a specific type of these systems,\nbased on cellular symport/antiport communication of chemicals.\nResults in the literature show that systems of this type that also allow cell\ndivision can solve PSPACE problems. In our study, we investigate systems that\nuse membrane separation instead of cell division, for which only limited\nresults are available. Notably, it has been shown that any problem solvable by\nsuch systems in polynomial time falls within the complexity class P^(#P).\nBy implementing a system solving MIDSAT, a P^(#P)-complete problem, we\ndemonstrate that the reverse inclusion is true as well, thus providing an exact\ncharacterization of the problem class solvable by P systems with\nsymport/antiport and membrane separation.\nMoreover, our implementation uses rules of length at most three.

      "content": "Authors: Erin W. Chambers, Guangyu Meng\n\nReeb graphs are a fundamental structure for analyzing the topological and\ngeometric properties of scalar fields. Comparing Reeb graphs is crucial for\nadvancing research in this domain, yet existing metrics are often\ncomputationally prohibitive or fail to capture essential topological features\neffectively. In this paper, we explore the application of the\nGromov-Wasserstein distance, a versatile metric for comparing metric measure\nspaces, to Reeb graphs. We propose a framework integrating a symmetric variant\nof the Reeb radius for robust geometric comparison, and a novel probabilistic\nweighting scheme based on Persistence Images derived from extended persistence\ndiagrams to effectively incorporate topological significance. A key\ncontribution of this work is the rigorous theoretical proof of the stability of\nour proposed Reeb Gromov-Wasserstein distance with respect to perturbations in\nthe underlying scalar fields. This ensures that small changes in the input data\nlead to small changes in the computed distance between Reeb graphs, a critical\nproperty for reliable analysis. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach,\nincluding its enhanced ability to capture topological features and its proven\nstability, through comparisons with other alternatives on several datasets,\nshowcasing its practical utility and theoretical soundness.\n"

      "content": "Authors: Benjamin Kraljusic, Zlatan Ajanovic, Nermin Covic, Bakir Lacevic\n\nThis work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that\ncombines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core\ncontribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free\nconfiguration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph\nsearch algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space,\nburs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to\nfixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid\npath and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within\nthe existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated\nthrough a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying\nnumber of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity.

For directed integer-weighted graphs, we significantly\nimprove this bound by designing an algorithm that computes an $(s,t)$-cut of\nsecond minimum capacity using $O(\\sqrt{n})$ maximum (s,t)-flow computations\nw.h.p. To achieve this result, a close relationship of independent interest is\nestablished between $(s,t)$-cuts of second minimum capacity and global mincuts\nin directed weighted graphs.\n  Minimum+1 (s,t)-cuts have been studied quite well recently [Baswana,\nBhanja, and Pandey, ICALP 2022], which is a special case of second\n(s,t)-mincut.\n(a) For directed multi-graphs, we design an algorithm that, given any maximum\n(s,t)-flow, computes a minimum+1 (s,t)-cut, if it exists, in $O(m)$ time.\n(b) The existing structures for storing and characterizing all minimum+1\n(s,t)-cuts occupy $O(mn)$ space.

We allow each\nquery to produce three results: zero, one, or unknown. The output could also\nbe: zero, one, or unknown, with the constraint that we should output\n‘‘unknown’’ only when we cannot determine the answer from the revealed input\nbits. Such an extension of a Boolean function is called its hazard-free\nextension.\n\n  We prove an analogue of Huang’s celebrated sensitivity theorem [Annals of\nMathematics, 2019] in our model of query complexity with uncertainty.\n  We show that the deterministic query complexity of the hazard-free\nextension of a Boolean function is at most quadratic in its randomized query\ncomplexity and quartic in its quantum query complexity, improving upon the\nbest-known bounds in the Boolean world.\n  We exhibit an exponential gap between the smallest depth (size) of decision\ntrees computing a Boolean function, and those computing its hazard-free\nextension.\n  We present general methods to convert decision trees for Boolean functions\nto those for their hazard-free counterparts, and show optimality of this\nconstruction. We also parameterize this result by the maximum number of unknown\nvalues in the input.\n  We show lower bounds on size complexity of decision trees for hazard-free\nextensions of Boolean functions in terms of the number of prime implicants and\nprime implicates of the underlying Boolean function.\n\n"

The \\textit{size} of such a cover is the sum of the sizes of the\nbicliques. Small-size biclique covers of graphs are ubiquitous in computational\ngeometry, and have been shown to be useful compact representations of graphs.\nWe give a brief survey of classical and recent results on biclique covers and\ntheir applications, and give new families of graphs having biclique covers of\nnear-linear size.\nIn particular, we show that semilinear graphs, whose edges are defined by\nlinear relations in bounded dimensional space, always have biclique covers of\nsize $O(n\\polylog n)$. This generalizes many previously known results on\nspecial classes of graphs including interval graphs, permutation graphs, and\ngraphs of bounded boxicity, but also new classes such as intersection graphs of\nL-shapes in the plane. It also directly implies the bounds for Zarankiewicz’s\nproblem derived by Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran (\\textit{Forum\nMath.

This provides a simple combinatorial analogue of a classical\nresult from Agarwal, Alon, Aronov, and Suri on polygon visibility graphs\n(\\textit{Discrete Comput. Geom.} 1994).\nFinally, we prove that there exists families of unit disk graphs on $n$\nvertices that do not admit biclique coverings of size $o(n^{4/3})$, showing\nthat we are unlikely to improve on Szemer'edi-Trotter type incidence bounds\nfor higher-degree semialgebraic graphs.\n"

One of the lesser reasons is that it also hosts an interesting collection of geometric street art, some of which I photographed on my recent visit.\n\nThe first thing you see as you enter the city by the main entrance of its train station is Tsuzumimon, a massive ornamental wooden gate. The two pillars of the gate are made from wood beams in two layers that twist around each pillar in opposite directions. The lintel connecting the two pillars is a lattice of more wood, in a rounded form rather than the more traditional straight beam. The gate supports one end of an airy steel and glass space-frame dome, sheltering the plaza in front of the station from the frequent rain.\n\n\n\nTsuzumi are a certain type of Japanese hand drum, so Tsuzumimon means drum gate, because of the resemblance of the pillars to these drums. But instead, what it most reminds me of is a partition of space into skew lines that I ray-traced in 2010 and use as the header for my Mastodon account page.\n\n\n\nA short way along the road to the fish market (worth multiple visits), one encounters this piece, “Corpus Minor #1” by Janne Kristian Virkkunen. Another conference participant told me he thought it resembled a shipping mine, but what it brings to mind to me is either an atomic nucleus or a morula (the complex of cells of a multi-cell organism at the stage of reproduction before they differentiate).\n\n\n\nHere’s a more abstracted close-up look.\n\n\n\nI’m pretty sure its underlying geometric structure comes from a tetrakis hexahedron, whose edges form the prominent ribs of the sculpture. This would allow it to be constructed by bolting together 24 identical triangular pieces, each containing smoothed-together patches from three of the 14 spherical bulges of the sculpture.\n\n\n\nThe part of Kanazawa between the station and the fish market is dominated by major boulevards filled with cars, and long waits for crosswalks. To make it somewhat less unfriendly to pedestrian traffic, the city has installed underpasses at several of the major crossings. It’s easy to miss the next piece, at the central hub of the underpass connecting to the fish market itself.\n\n\n\nAlso seen but not photographed: another large ornamental gate near the back entrance of the station, made of slanted concrete pillars and resembling a support structure for an elevated highway; a black stone monkey saddle in the basement level of the station, near a scale model of Tsuzumimon; a tangled tree of shiny stainless steel tubes across the street from my hotel (a block south of the station); a stylized sundial between the station and the fish market (not very effective in the rain); and many public fountains.\n\n(Discuss on Mastodon)\n\nBy David Eppstein\n"

Whereas the first year was experimental and finding my footing, the second year has been decidedly more routine. That’s not a bad thing, as I love rituals. Wake up, brush my teeth, make two pour-over coffees, be harassed by the cat, blog.1 There’s a reassurance in these daily rituals themselves, where the process can be as rewarding as the product.\n\nI’m only half joking about having a blogging rule book. I’ve never written it down, but some of the rules are\n\n\n  Spend the first hour of each working day blogging.\n  Aim for 1000 words. If I hit that number, publish.\n  If I don’t hit 1000 words today, try to finish the piece tomorrow.\n  Make equations with LaTeXit, 14 pt font.\n  Every equation halves your readership (This is a Stephen Hawking rule.)\n  Don’t overthink the titles.\n  A banner by Isaac Sparks goes at the top of each post, subscribe button at the bottom.\n  14:00 GMT is international posting time. (This is a Brian Whitman rule.)\n  Aim for two posts a week. Don’t post more than four.\n\n\nI have a different set of rules for class liveblogging. I invented my own set of rules for working through Meehl’s course. Maybe I should spend more time writing these rules down. I’m sure there are many more I haven’t even articulated to myself.\n\nWhatever the case, I’ve got a process now and I’m sticking to it. The rules are oddly freeing. Rules give you a “freedom from choice,” paring down the degrees of freedom to one where you are able to create but are not overwhelmed by options. They are “constraints that deconstrain,” facilitating improvisation within the narrow boundaries of the ruleset.\n\nPart of my obsession with bureaucracy is that I love rules, and yet bureaucratic rules so frequently lack the deconstraining property that lets people flourish. Making matters worse, bureaucratic processes stifle course correction because by their nature. They are necessarily ossified and onerous to change. That’s a topic for a longer conversation in another post.\n\nIn any event, while I don’t have a clear idea of the topics I’ll be covering in year three of the argmin substack, I do know the starting rule book I’ll be using. And I’m trying to think a bit about rule changes for the upcoming season.2\n\nPart of these rule changes will be adapting to new goals for this season. One thing I haven’t been able to do is use my blogging time as “real writing” time. I’ve taken some mornings and tried to work on other writing projects during my allotted blogging time, and it hasn’t been helpful. That’s interesting in itself. This blog post writing is fundamentally different from the more archival writing, and the latter needs its own set of rules.\n\nI should figure those rules out because I am in a stage where I should write a few more papers. You know, blog posts with DOIs. I don’t want to write too many papers, but some folks have suggested that it would be helpful to collect and collate some of the meandering thoughts here into tighter arguments. My blog posts are first drafts of thoughts, not finished ones. I don’t consider any of the arguments here to be definitive. I love that you all think out loud with me. Nonetheless, some of them are worth preserving in academic amber, and I need to do my scholarly duties of mailing pdfs to my friends. I’ve written two blog posts with DOIs this year (this one, that one), and I have three or four more I should try to finish. I also have a few more books in me that I want to write. I will have more news on that front coming very soon. Finding the right way to balance writing time is going to be an important part of argmin year three.\n\nAnother goal is finding the best balance for the multiple audiences who read this. Some posts get very technical, but there is a slice of the readership that enjoys those. I have tried to maintain a balance that doesn’t alienate those who don’t want the math, while also engaging with those who do. I could split this blog into multiple newsletters, but that seems like a lot of unnecessary work, and I know everyone must have incredible substack subscription fatigue at this point. I could perhaps signal at the top of each post whether I’m going to get into the weeds. If you have any ideas on how to strike the right balance and send the right signals, please send me an email or leave a comment. Hopefully, you folks who agree to be spammed by me are fine with closing the posts that are too hypertechnical and selectively reading the ones that hook you.\n\nRegardless, I love the feedback you send me, and I apologize if I miss any or don’t reply. I read them all and value them all. I look forward to more of them in year three.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n1\n\nThe cat apparently also loves rituals.\n\n2\n\nArgmin blog will not be banning the tush push.\n\nBy Ben Recht\n"

We\nformulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is\nto deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting\ndisplacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our\nmethod processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations\nsuch as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we\nconsider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior\ndeform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive\ntool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise\nadjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic\ncontrol.

      "content": "Authors: Jing Huang, Hao Su, Kwok Wai Samuel Au\n\nThis paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e.,\npassage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths’\ntraversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP\nis utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its\nentire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As\npassages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core\nidea is to leverage the path’s passage traversal status to characterize its\naccessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection\nand free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,\nenabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment\ndecompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with\naccessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems\ncompatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based\nalgorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are\ndeveloped leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.\nAll these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and\nefficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based\nmethods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution\noptimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It\nis believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free\nspace optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad\nclass of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.\n"

While most local search algorithms aim\nto improve given solutions by performing one single operation on a given\nsolution, the parameterized approach aims to improve a solution by performing\n$k$ simultaneous operations. Herein, $k$ is a parameter called search radius\nfor which the value can be chosen by a user. One major goal in the field of\nparameterized local search is to outline the trade-off between the size of $k$\nand the running time of the local search step. In this work, we introduce an\nabstract framework that generalizes natural parameterized local search\napproaches for a large class of partitioning problems: Given $n$ items that are\npartitioned into $b$ bins and a target function that evaluates the quality of\nthe current partition, one asks whether it is possible to improve the solution\nby removing up to $k$ items from their current bins and reassigning them to\nother bins.

This\nproblem generalizes Vertex Cover (when $x = 0$), and has applications in\nnetwork design, epidemiology, and social network analysis. We investigate the\nparameterized complexity of Critical Node Cut under various structural\nparameters. We first significantly strengthen existing hardness results by\nproving W[1]-hardness even when parameterized by the combined parameter $k +\n\\mathrm{fes} + \\Delta + \\mathrm{pw}$, where $\\mathrm{fes}$ is the feedback edge\nset number, $\\Delta$ the maximum degree, and $\\mathrm{pw}$ the pathwidth of the\ninput graph.
